Over the next two weeks, Iran and its allies mobilized troops and fired on Saudi warships. But they also unleashed an arsenal of high-technology weapons to try to destabilize the Saudi Government and prevent the United States from intervening.\r\nA huge refinery near Dhahran was destroyed by an explosion and fire because of a mysterious malfunction in its computerized controls. A software "logic bomb" caused a "new Metro-Superliner" to slam into a misrouted freight train near Laurel, Md., killing 60 people and critically injuring another 120. The Bank of England found "sniffer" programs running amok in its electronic funds transfer system. And a "computer worm" started corrupting files in the Pentagon''s top-secret force-deployment data base.\r\nThe opening scenes from a Hollywood script or a new Tom Clancy novel? No, these are excerpts from a role-playing game conducted last year at the Government''s National Defense University in Washington. The goal was to generate some serious thinking about "information warfare."\r\nToday, there are a lot of people thinking seriously about information warfare, not only at the Pentagon and the C.I.A. but also in the executive offices of banks, securities firms and other companies. Once dismissed as the stuff of science fiction, high-tech information warfare is fast becoming a reality.\r\nMilitary and intelligence officials believe that enemy nations, terrorists and criminal groups either already have the capability to mount information warfare strikes or soon will. Criminals are quickly progressing beyond the vandalism and petty theft associated with teen-aged hackers and into robbery and extortion schemes ranging up to millions of dollars, corporate executives and private investigators say.\r\nIn the future, they fear, information warfare assaults could be made against commercial networks like the banking system or utilities in several states.\r\nYet there is a heated debate among experts in this emerging field about whether the kinds of catastrophic incidents cited in the National Defense University war game are imminent threats or worst-case nightmares.\r\n"A couple of years ago, no one took information warfare seriously," said Howard Frank, director of the information technology office at the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, or Darpa. "But the more you learn about it, the more concerned you become."\r\nOthers reply that the worst threats mentioned are mostly speculation. "Information warfare is a risk to our nation''s economy and defense," said Martin Libicki, a senior fellow at the National Defense University. "But I believe we will find ways to cope with these attacks, adjust and shake them off, just as we do to natural disasters like hurricanes."\r\nExperts on both sides of the debate do agree that the growing reliance on computer networks and telecommunications is making the nation increasingly vulnerable to "cyberattacks" on military war rooms, power plants, telephone networks, air traffic control centers and banks.\r\nJohn M. Deutch, the Director of Central Intelligence, told Congress in June that such assaults "could not only disrupt our daily lives, but also seriously jeopardize our national and economic security."\r\n"The electron, in my view," Mr. Deutch warned, "is the ultimate precision-guided weapon."\r\nPresident Clinton created a Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in July to craft a coordinated policy to deal with the threat. Within the Government, information warfare tactics and intelligence are highly classified issues. But the C.I.A. has recently created an Information Warfare Center. And the National Security Agency intends to set up an information warfare unit staffed by as many as 1,000 people, with both offensive and defensive expertise, as well as a 24-hour response team, according to a staff report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The report was initiated by Senator Sam Nunn.\r\nInformation warfare is a catch-all term. The military, for example, often refers to information warfare broadly to include time-tested techniques and tools like disinformation, cryptography, radio jamming and bombing communications centers.\r\nBut it is high-tech information warfare that has been getting most of the attention and funds lately. This budding warfare industry is an eclectic field indeed, ranging from computer scientists whose work is financed by the Government to "hackers for hire" who specialize in theft, extortion and sabotage. In his Senate testimony, Mr. Deutch said the C.I.A. had determined that cyberattacks were now "likely to be within the capabilities of a number of terrorist groups," including the Hezbollah in the Middle East.\r\nThe weapons of information warfare are mostly computer software, like destructive logic bombs and eavesdropping sniffers, or advanced electronic hardware, like a high-energy radio frequency device, known as a HERF gun. In theory, at least, these weapons could cripple the computer systems that control everything from the electronic funds transfer systems of banks to electric utilities to battlefield tanks.\r\nFor the military, information warfare raises the prospect of a new deal for America''s adversaries. Cyberwar units could sidestep or cripple conventional weaponry, undermining the advantage the United States holds.\r\n"Even a third-tier country has access to first-class programmers, to state-of-the-art computer hardware and expertise in this area," said Barry Horton, principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, who oversees the Pentagon''s information warfare operations. "There is a certain leveling of the playing field."\r\nCyberspace also plays havoc with traditional definitions: what is a military and what is a commercial target, if 95 percent of military communications are over commercial networks; what is within United States jurisdiction and what is an international issue, when cyberspace has no geographic borders? "We have to redefine national security for the information age," Mr. Horton said.\r\nThere is, to be sure, an aspect of self-interest in the information warfare alarms raised by military and intelligence agencies. Those bureaucracies are sizable and costly, and in the post-cold-war era, they are in need of new enemies.\r\n"The people who are concerned about information warfare tend to magnify its significance," said Mr. Libicki of the National Defense University.\r\nThe Electronic Industries Association estimates that over the next decade, the Government''s information warfare procurement, mainly for specialized software and services, will grow sevenfold, to more than $1 billion annually.\r\nYet the projected spending on information warfare amounts to pocket change, compared with next year''s military budget of $257 billion. "The point of information warfare is that you don''t need fighter planes and billions of dollars to launch an attack on the United States anymore," said Winn Schwartau, an author and president of Interpact Inc., a security consulting firm.\r\nThe Government''s computer systems are clearly susceptible to intruders. In 1988, a Cornell student sent a worm program over the Internet that penetrated military and intelligence systems, shutting down 6,000 computers. In 1994, a 16-year-old British hacker broke into the computer system at an Air Force laboratory in Rome, N.Y. And in "red team" exercises, the military''s experts have been able to break into 65 percent of the Defense Department systems they tried to penetrate, using hacking tools available over the Internet.\r\nBut nearly all these intrusions have been into some of the two million computers in military networks that handle unclassified information -- that information can, however, be useful to enemies, military officials concede. The classified information is on the other 10 percent of the military''s computer networks, which do not have open links to the outside.\r\nPrivate companies and banks typically do not have the luxury of making their networks off-limits to outsiders. "We invite our customers into our computer networks," said Colin Crook, the senior technology officer of Citibank. "I think our problem is more challenging than the Government''s."\r\nCitibank got an alarming brush with the problem two years ago, when a Russian computer hacker tapped into the bank''s funds-transfer system, taking more than $10 million. Citibank will not discuss the case, but investigators say the bank recovered all but $400,000.\r\nIn the business world, the reported hacker activity to date is mostly stealing credit card numbers, vandalizing software or harassing Internet service companies. "At the moment, we''re dealing with penny ante stuff," said Peter Neumann, a computer scientist at SRI International, a research firm in Menlo Park, Calif. "But the risk of much greater damage is there."\r\nMr. Frank of Darpa speaks of a "frightening vulnerability" of utilities systems, of the private data networks of the international financial system and of the digital switches at the core of modern phone systems.\r\nMajor breakdowns caused by computer intruders have not yet occurred. But there is evidence that more sophisticated hackers are now at work. The Science Applications International Corporation, a military contractor and technology security firm, surveyed more than 40 major corporations, which confidentially reported that they lost an estimated $800 million because of computer break-ins last year, both in lost intellectual property and money.\r\nPrivate investigators and bankers say they are aware of four banks, three in Europe and one in New York, that have made recent payments of roughly $100,000 each to hacker extortionists. The bankers and investigators would not identify the banks, but the weapon used to blackmail the banks was a logic bomb -- a software program that, when detonated, could cripple a bank''s internal computer system. In each case, the sources said, the banks paid the money, and then took new security measures.\r\nFrequently, experts say, the tighter security measures are nothing fancy. One problem is modems on employees'' computers. They are open connections to the outside world, potentially giving hackers access to an internal network.\r\n"You can''t eliminate risk of information attacks, but you can minimize it," said William J. Marlow, a senior vice president of Science Applications International. "Many of the steps are not all that high-tech or expensive."\r\nSince it was stung in the Russia episode, Citibank has taken a series of measures, from instructing employees to never assume a computer network is secure to aggressively pursuing hackers. "You mess with us and we''re going after you," Mr. Crook said. "This is a big deal for us now."\r\n\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: September 30, 1996\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: Charts: "The Targets"\r\nThe potential targets range from financial markets to tanks.

Clarke is the White House terrorism czar. His stock in trade is the stuff of techno-thrillers -- biological bombs in the Wall Street subway, chemical clouds of death in the Pentagon parking lot, cyberwar attacks crippling the nation''s computers.\r\nPale as skim milk, his once-red hair gone white at 48, he works long days and nights in Oliver North''s old office at the National Security Council, keeping a profile so low that almost no one outside his top-secret world knows he exists.\r\nAs chairman of the Government''s chief counter-terrorism group for the last seven years, he has become what John le Carre calls an "intellocrat" -- a gray baron who seems to command nothing more than his desk, yet waves a wand and sends soldiers, guns, money and spies around the world.\r\nMr. Clarke inspires ferocious loyalty from friends and fierce enmity from foes inside the Government. He wins praise for getting things done in secret -- and criticism for exactly the same. At the National Security Council, where he landed in 1992 after losing his State Department job in a bitter battle over Israel''s misuse of American military technology, he can operate without outside oversight so long as he has President Clinton''s confidence.\r\nHe has it. The President recently selected him as the nation''s counter-terrorism coordinator, a new and powerful post. He has to try to coordinate everything from the Pentagon and its evolving plans to defend the United States against terrorists down to local police and fire departments. Despite years of effort to pull it all together, this has never been accomplished. There is no 911 number for the nation.\r\nThe mission of protecting Americans from attack, whether by states or rogue groups, is "almost the primary responsibility of the Government," Mr. Clarke says. He is trying to raise the fear of terrorism in the United States to the right level -- higher, not too high -- as he girds the nation against the possibility of an assault from nerve gas, bacteria and viruses, and from what he calls "an electronic Pearl Harbor."\r\nHe has to walk a fine line. "You want people to understand the peril without panicking," said Anthony Lake, his boss at the National Security Council from 1993 to 1996.\r\nMr. Clarke has a reserved seat when Cabinet officers gather at the White House on national security issues. "My name is on the table next to Madeleine Albright and Bill Cohen," the secretaries of State and Defense, Mr. Clarke said. His vote carries the weight of those cast by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Central Intelligence.\r\nHe helped drive the decision to fire cruise missiles at Afghanistan and Sudan in August, trying to strike at Osama bin Laden, overpowering dissenters at the State Department and the C.I.A. Now he is helping to steer secret operations aimed at capturing the Saudi exile, who is accused of bombing two American embassies.\r\nMr. Clarke also has written at least four classified Presidential directives on terrorism. They helped expand the Government''s counter-terrorism cadres into the $11 billion-a-year enterprise he now coordinates, stifling some protests at the Justice Department and the Pentagon, which saw him as a competitor for money and power.\r\nIn his office, where a small sign reads "Think Globally/Act Globally," he spoke passionately about the threat of cyberwar, invisible attacks on the nation''s computers, a terror so insidious, so arcane he has trouble convincing corporate chieftains and political commissars that it is real. But it is out there, he says, even if he can''t prove it.\r\n"There is a problem convincing people that there is a threat," he said. "There is disbelief and resistance. Most people don''t understand. C.E.O.''s of big corporations don''t even know what I''m talking about. They think I''m talking about a 14-year-old hacking into their Web sites.\r\n"I''m talking about people shutting down a city''s electricity," he said, "shutting down 911 systems, shutting down telephone networks and transportation systems. You black out a city, people die. Black out lots of cities, lots of people die. It''s as bad as being attacked by bombs.\r\n"An attack on American cyberspace is an attack on the United States, just as much as a landing on New Jersey," he said. "The notion that we could respond with military force against a cyber-attack has to be accepted."\r\nWhy would anyone want to mount such an attack? "To extort us," he said. "To intimidate us. To get us to abandon our foreign policy -- ''Abandon Israel or else!''\r\n"Imagine a few years from now: A President goes forth and orders troops to move. The lights go out, the phones don''t ring, the trains don''t move. That''s what we mean by an electronic Pearl Harbor."\r\nEnemies and allies alike say Mr. Clarke wins battles by working longer hours and twisting more arms. "I like Dick so much for the same reason that some people have not liked him: He has a passion for getting things done," said Mr. Lake. "That can be abrasive."\r\nWhen thorny questions entangle political, military, diplomatic and intelligence issues, Mr. Clarke cuts the knot. Are there human rights concerns over sending helicopters to Colombia''s army? Send the choppers. Does the State Department want to reopen its embassy in the Sudan, after reports of terrorist threats proved empty? Keep it shuttered.\r\n"He''s a hammer," said Leslie Gelb, who gave him his first job at the State Department 20 years ago.\r\n"If there is something to slam through, that''s his task -- to get people to do things they don''t want to do," said Mr. Gelb, now president of the Council on Foreign Relations, and formerly a reporter and columnist for The New York Times. "You don''t expect the highest quotient of political sensibility from Dick. They didn''t hire him for that."\r\nUnder President Reagan, Mr. Clarke was the second-ranking intelligence officer at the State Department. His boss was Morton Abramowitz. "Dick is aggressive," Mr. Abramowitz said, "a man with strong views, with a great ability to tell people what the issues are without spending 10 years doing it. He''s a low-profile guy. He has mixed feelings about having a profile at all."\r\nMr. Clarke''s profile first surfaced in 1986. He was an intellectual author of a plan to use psychological warfare against the Libyan leader, Muammar el-Qaddafi. Under his plan, flights of SR-71 spy planes set off "sonic booms over his head, to tell him his air defenses couldn''t stop us," and mysterious American rafts floated up on the shores of Tripoli, Mr. Clarke said. The operation backfired when the Reagan White House was caught planting a false report in The Wall Street Journal about Libya''s support of terrorism.\r\nUnder President Bush, Mr. Clarke served as Assistant Secretary of State for political and military affairs. In 1992, he was accused by the State Department''s Inspector General of looking the other way as Israel transferred American military technology to China.\r\n"There was an allegation that we hadn''t investigated a huge body of evidence that the Israelis were involved in technology transfers," Mr. Clarke said. "In fact, we had investigated it. I knew more about it than anyone. We found one instance where it was true. The Israelis had taken aerial refueling technology we sold them and sold it to a Latin American country. We caught them, and they admitted they had done it."\r\nHe added: "The Administration wanted to put heat on the Israeli Government to create an atmosphere in which the incumbent Government might lose an election. The bottom line was I wasn''t going to lie. I wasn''t going to go along with an Administration strategy to pressure the Israeli Government."\r\nSherman Funk, the Inspector General who accused Mr. Clarke, remembered the case differently.\r\n"He''s wrong," said Mr. Funk, the State Department''s Inspector General from 1987 to 1994. "He''s being very disingenuous. Dick Clarke was unilaterally adopting a policy that was counter to the law and counter to the avowed policy of the Government. It was not up to him to make that determination. Almost all the people in his own office disagreed with him. In the end, he had to leave the State Department."\r\nMr. Clarke joined the National Security Council staff under President Bush. He was one of the only holdovers embraced by the Clinton Administration. After seven years, he has placed proteges in key diplomatic and intelligence positions, creating a network of loyalty and solidifying his power.', '');

Hamre, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, said in a closed-door hearing that this new method had been uncovered by analysts at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren, Va., Defense Department officials said.\r\nThe specialists at Dahlgren found a method to thwart those low-level probes that differ from the more frequent brutal assaults on security systems and alerted all the military services to the new problem and a remedy for it.\r\n"There are literally hundreds of attempts weekly to break into the computers," a Pentagon spokesman said. "It''s constant because there''s a certain cachet to getting into the Pentagon system."\r\nThe Pentagon has estimated that 99.95 percent of computer hackers fail to penetrate beyond the open networks, which contain unclassified material, and so pose no national security concern.\r\nThe most notable example of hackers using this new method occurred in January when a military computer server near San Antonio was probed for two days from foreign Web sites. These probes reached only the open military networks connected to the Internet and it was unclear whether the probes originated overseas or were merely routed through those sites.\r\n"These hackers try to cover their tracks by initiating the intrusions through an overseas site that has nothing to do with where the hackers actually are," the Pentagon spokesman said.\r\nIn the last year, each armed service has installed new programs to detect hackers and to protect sensitive material. As the number of surveillance programs have increased, so has the number of detections.\r\nThese new military computer security officials have said they are fighting a "cyberwar."\r\n"To them it''s a war, but it''s like the war on crime or the war on drugs -- it''s the information security guys'' war," said William Arkin, author of "The U.S. Military On Line." "But it''s not a real war."', '');

The Pentagon created a new military center to harness the nation''s disparate cyberwarfare forces under the Air Force Space Command at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. That followed the public acknowledgment by Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that the United States played hacker itself earlier this year -- waging a keyboard war against Serbian computer networks.\r\nBeyond challenging America''s own military culture and requiring sophisticated technology, cyberwarfare raises a fundamental philosophical question. The biggest challenge that such warfare may pose for democratic societies is that it further blurs the line between military and nonmilitary targets.\r\n"Cyberwarfare involves deliberately targeting noncombatants," said Mark D. Rasch, a former Federal prosecutor and an expert on legal issues in computer security. "Frequently you''re not going after a Government or military or some strategic target -- you''re going after Con Ed."\r\nThe new command''s first mission will be to coordinate the defense of the military''s computer networks against foreign threats and cyberterrorists. Soon after the mission will expand to include offense: Joint Task Force Computer Network Attack, in Pentagon jargon, designed to conduct wartime military operations against computer networks in enemy countries.\r\nThe addition of an information-war fighting capability to the Pentagon''s quiver takes activities that have largely been confined to covert military and intelligence operations and makes them part of the nation''s military chain of command.\r\nAt the same time, the new center is a public acknowledgment that as the world''s most technically advanced nation, the United States is also potentially the most vulnerable to foreign cyberthreats.\r\nThe specter of simultaneous computer network attacks against banking, transportation, commerce and utility targets -- as well as against the military -- conjures up the fear of an electronic Pearl Harbor in which the nation is paralyzed without a single bullet ever being fired.\r\nBut the real-world challenge faced by the military is likely to be more subtle.\r\n"The threat is going to be death by a thousand cuts, rather than a giant attack," said a former top military scientist. "There will be a little bit of this and a little bit of that."\r\nTHIS ghost-in-the-machine threat is perhaps the military''s worst nightmare and also the one that a closed and secretive military organization may have the most difficulty combating.\r\n"We think we can throw technology at this but it''s not a technology problem at all," said Ronald J. Knecht, a former Pentagon official who helped develop information warfare policy for three decades and who is now senior vice president for corporate development at the Science Applications International Corporation, a large military contractor.\r\nThe challenge, he said, is to change a military culture that has fought wars with bombs and tanks into one that fights with bits and bytes.\r\n"Preparing for cyberwar will force the nation to rethink the way it fights wars," said Steven Lukasik, a military analyst at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University and a former director of the Pentagon''s Advanced Research Projects Agency.\r\n"We''ve been trained to fight nuclear wars where static defenses are fatal," he said. "But in information warfare we have to rethink everything. It may be that Maginot Lines have basically gotten a bad name." In other words, building impenetrable electronic walls may be a more effective tactic in cyberwarfare.\r\nAdeeper challenge for the Pentagon may be keeping pace with Silicon Valley''s fast-paced consumer technology companies. Until the end of the cold war, the most powerful computer technology would trickle down from a handful of defense contractors and supercomputer companies financed by the Pentagon.\r\nIn the past decade, however, the most powerful computer technologies are increasingly made by companies that make products that go under Christmas trees. To cope with the consumer technology challenge the Central Intelligence Agency announced plans this month to set up a venture capital fund to gain quicker access to state-of-art technologies being incubated in Silicon Valley.\r\nBut the Pentagon''s problem may be compounded because the technology is the same as in consumer products but the rules of cyberwarfare are different, said Mr. Knecht of Stanford.\r\nHe said a military commander should expect an attack that blocks access to his computer networks "and he should assume that somebody who has approved access to his networks is working for the other side -- and still be ready to fight a war."', '');

The messages were from a person who said he was based in Russia and who identified himself as Maxus, Maxim and Pi2000.\r\nA number of security experts said that, depending on the extortionist''s skill, tracking him through the Internet could present a formidable challenge. One researcher who has been trying to track him said that despite the extortionist''s identifying himself as a Russian, his e-mail program indicated that he was in a country one time zone to the west of Russia, probably in Eastern Europe.\r\nBut e-mail messages sent to reporters over the weekend came from the computer server of a small design company in Paris, suggesting that the extortionist was using masking techniques to hide his true Internet location.\r\nIn December, rather than paying the extortion demand, CD Universe contacted the F.B.I. and tried to maintain an e-mail conversation with the credit card thief in an effort to trace his location.\r\nThe illegal credit card site was secretly established on the computers of an Internet service in Kirkland, Wash., on Christmas Day. The site enabled World Wide Web computer users to view and copy stolen credit card numbers that the thief said were stolen from CD Universe. More than 25,000 card numbers were downloaded from the site before it was shut down.\r\nThe computer security expert who received the first tip from the extortionist said today that he expected the credit card information to show up at new Internet locations.\r\n"He will probably find another location to dispense the stolen information," said Elias Levy, chief technology officer for SecurityFocus .com, a computer security firm in San Francisco. "We''ll also probably see information about the new site being passed around within the computer underground."\r\nThe attack comes as the Clinton administration has been pushing to expand sharply the ability of law enforcement to respond both to computer crime and terrorism.\r\nLast week, the administration introduced a proposal to increase spending by $280 million to build networks of surveillance systems to protect government computers and train a new corps of high-tech cyberwarriors to fight a new kind of electronic warfare.\r\nIn a speech at Stanford University today before the National Association of Attorneys General, Attorney General Janet Reno proposed a national crime fighting network, to be called Lawnet, intended to link law-enforcement officials and share information, intelligence and equipment in an effort to match what she described as the "dark side" of the Internet.\r\nMs. Reno also emphasized new initiatives by the administration for international cooperation to fight crime taking place over the Internet.\r\n"The whole concept of the globalization of crime is making this work difficult," she said. "The cybercriminals should get the message that there is no safe place to hide just because they are halfway around the world."', '');

At first it was a combination playground, library and meeting house for scientists and soldiers, an inviolate virtual world. Companies later tried to turn it into a mall. Now, it''s becoming a borderless battlefield.\r\nIn recent weeks, the Middle East conflict spilled over into the Internet as Web sites throughout the region have been altered with messages advocating online attacks against other sites, both Israeli and pro-Palestinian -- in some cases providing the software that make such attacks possible.\r\nThis isn''t the first conflict to see hacker activity; similar incidents have occurred in the Balkans, Russia, Mexico and China. "It''s become almost standard practice in any political conflict to see that occur," said Eugene Spafford, a computer security expert who runs the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security at Purdue University\r\nAnd like the Internet itself, this cyber warfare simply ignores national boundaries. Many attacks on Israeli sites have originated in Pakistan, as did an attack earlier this month against the Web site for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a lobbying group. The site was defaced with anti-Israeli commentary. But this exploit took cyberwar a step further: the attacker stole some 3,500 e-mail addresses and 700 credit card numbers, sent anti-Israeli diatribes to the addresses and published the credit card data on the Internet.\r\nIn an e-mail interview, the Pakistani hacker who took credit for the attack, who uses the online name Doctor Nuker, said he founded the Pakistani Hackerz Club with a friend, "Mr. Sweet," "to hack for the injustice going around the globe, especially with Muslims."\r\nHe said he published the private information about some of the lobbying group''s contributors because "they are the supporters of Israel too."\r\nMichael Salberg, a New York lawyer whose personal information hit the Web as part of the attack, said he was shaken by the ability of participants in a faraway conflict to affect him personally. Mr. Salberg said he found it chillingly ironic that he found out about the incident while attending the annual meeting of the National Commission of the Anti-Defamation League, the policymaking and governing body of an organization that opposes the use of hateful speech in the real and virtual worlds.\r\nSome call this infowar: the use of high technology and, particularly, the Internet to mount attacks. But much of the recent activity falls under a new buzzword: "hacktivism," a portmanteau term drawn from "hacker" and "activism."\r\nOnline pundits have long predicted hacktivism would be a force, but it was not widespread until recently, said B. K. DeLong, who works with attrition.org, a nonprofit site that monitors hacking activity.\r\nCiting Election Day attacks on Web sites of the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States, as well as the attack on the lobbying group, Mr. DeLong said, "This is the most hacktivism we''ve seen in months."\r\nAnd while most defacements simply contain semiliterate bragging, the hacktivists aim for a more intellectual effect. The Republicans'' site was altered to begin, "As my dear friend Thomas Paine once said, these *are* the times that try men''s souls." (The asterisks, a computerese way to add emphasis, were supplied by the hackers and not the Revolutionary-era champion of liberty.)\r\nTrying times, indeed. What would Tom Paine say about this? The Supreme Court has declared the Internet the most perfect example the world has yet produced of the marketplace of ideas that the founders envisioned. Yet the founders abhorred those who would shout others down in argument, as the hacktivists do.\r\nRECENT sites attacked in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict include the Partners in Torah site for Jewish information and the All-Kosher Index of the United Kashrut Authority -- sites far removed from the conflict and used by people searching for information. By blocking such sites, are cyberwarriors engaging in the equivalent of bombing libraries?\r\nThat''s a minor consideration for Michael O''Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who said that today''s hacktivism could help military organizations prepare for the worst. "People do you the favor of attacking you so often that you have a chance to build up protection," he said. "Had Israel overlooked the weaknesses still inherent in the Internet and had critical military networks depend on the network, it was leaving itself vulnerable. It''s a great way to figure out where your weaknesses are."\r\nAmitai Etzioni, a professor of sociology at George Washington University, sees even more good news in the cyberattacks. Perhaps wishfully, he says they move people from the battlefield and into the virtual world, from war, with its real bullets and blood, to pretend war, with its computer game casualties.\r\n"If all wars could be so converted," he theorized, "it would be wonderful." Ultimately, Professor Etzioni said, today''s attacks are "cybergrafitti." "It may be annoying," he said, "but it''s harmless."\r\nSo far.\r\nDavid J. Farber, an Internet pioneer who serves on the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online civil liberties group, says that as dependency on the Internet increases, cyberwarriors will do real damage. Businesses will collapse if customers can''t reach them online, power grids might be brought down with a mouse click.\r\nAT some point somebody''s going to get the brilliant idea, ''Why bomb them? Why not cyberbomb them?'' " Mr. Farber said.\r\nHe sees a day when disinformation experts will plant false rumors online -- the wartime equivalent of the PairGain scam, in which a stock speculator created a sham financial news item on a Web page that looked like part of a news service''s site. "There are going to be a lot of interesting experiments done in this kind of psychological warfare," he said.\r\nIf war is hell, cyberwar could turn out to be cyberhell. And we''re only beginning to discover what that means.\r\n', '');

Win the Information War', '2003-04-23', 'nyt', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/23/books/books-of-the-times-want-to-beat-the-enemy-win-the-information-war.html', 'THE NEW FACE OF WAR\r\nHow War Will Be Fought in the 21st Century\r\nBy Bruce Berkowitz\r\n257 pages. The Free Press. $26.\r\nBruce Berkowitz, a noted analyst at the RAND Corporation and the Hoover Institution at Stanford, has produced a readable and well-informed study of information technology and its implications for future warfare. Even though he wrote his book just before the conflict in Iraq, his observations about technology and its role in future warfare have not been radically altered by the outcome of the war to overthrow Saddam Hussein.\r\nMr. Berkowitz was prepared to conduct such a study, given his good grasp of several critical fields related to the broader subject: military technology, Pentagon bureaucratic politics and the recent history of American defense policymaking. His book has ample vignettes of interesting people and ideas in modern United States military history, and it displays a comprehension of the science behind much of the electronics and computer revolutions. It is a perfectly fine read for anyone looking for such an overview.\r\nBut the book also disappoints on multiple fronts. As technology analysis, it is too thin and falls flat by comparison with many other popular science books about the computer and Internet era written by even more expert individuals. As a history of important figures in modern American defense policy, it provides brief sketches of many remarkable people but without the depth and zest needed to make such a human-interest story come alive.\r\nAs defense prognostication, it is a bit chatty and anecdotal, offering bold statements about how modern information technologies promise the greatest change in warfare, not just in decades but in millennia, without a serious defense of such a grandiose thesis.\r\nNor does Mr. Berkowitz offer any particularly original thought about what future warfare will be like, or even do a good job of summarizing the prognostications of scholars like Alvin Toffler or a number of his own colleagues at RAND. Because he tries to do a bit of all of these things in such a short volume, he does none of them as well as he could or should.\r\nMr. Berkowitz''s book does display a considerable depth of knowledge. His various topics and anecdotes, each typically two or three pages long, range from the invention of the airplane to the invention of the Internet to the tactics of Al Qaeda to the pioneers of modern American dogfighting to the new cyberwarriors of American defense policy.\r\nHe briefly examines the 1991 Persian Gulf war, NATO''s 1999 war over Kosovo, the Afghanistan war, the Vietnam War, the two world wars and the cold war through the prism of information technology. All of these cases are used in one way or another to bolster his thesis that astronomical changes in information processing are producing radical changes in warfare today. All the dots are well connected in this narrative.\r\nFor the reader wishing a little bit of everything, this book therefore succeeds. But it is less impressive at informing in detail about anything in particular, or about proving its main point. Mr. Berkowitz does not do enough to explain the individual dots in his argument. And the connections between them may sometimes be the wrong ones.\r\nPart of the problem with his thesis is that he uses the term information to encompass too much. He claims that information is the crucial element in warfare, especially modern warfare, and hence he seems to place great stock in the modern computer and the Internet. In effect, however, Mr. Berkowitz places almost everything in warfare except main combat vehicles under the term information. For him the word includes the sensors that acquire battlefield data, the communications systems that move it around, the individuals who assess it, the military leaders who devise tactics based upon it and even the broader national strategies used to guide countries in their basic decisions about when and how to use force.\r\nBut by granting the term information such an expansive scope, Mr. Berkowitz makes his argument fuzzy. What are the implications of his thesis, if the role of information in modern warfare includes everything from spy satellites to the education of commanders to the global communications systems carrying data around the world to the computers processing the raw bits and bytes?\r\nIf his chief point is simply to claim that all of these things matter even more than in the past, and that the sexy performance parameters of traditional weapons like tanks and aircraft matter at least somewhat less, he is probably right. And that conclusion is important. But it is neither particularly original nor quite as radical a thesis as he seems to want to claim for his book.\r\nTake one specific example: the performance of coalition forces in Desert Storm in 1991. Mr. Berkowitz heralds this conflict as the dawning of the age of information in warfare, writing that "information technology has become so important in defining military power that it overwhelms almost everything else." Among the major manifestations of this new reality were the United States-led coalition''s ability to use precision weapons, its possession of satellite guidance systems for many troops on the ground (if not yet for bombs themselves), and its ability to carry out the famous "left hook" maneuver so decisively against Saddam Hussein''s forces because Iraq did not enjoy similar information capabilities.\r\nThere are two big problems with this claim, however. First, despite another 12 years of improvements in our information warfare capabilities that Mr. Berkowitz chronicles and raves about, and despite the relative dearth of modern information systems within Iraqi society and armed forces, the recent war highlighted other aspects of American military excellence just as much as information systems and high technology.\r\nSpecifically, the performance of special operations forces in the war''s early hours and days, as well as the skill of American and British ground forces in the urban battles of the war''s latter phases, were perhaps the most exceptional aspects of an impressive campaign. Airpower played an important role, as did modern information and communications systems, but they were perhaps less dominant than in the country''s previous wars.\r\nThat is not to knock technology or the personnel flying our airplanes and operating our command and control networks; it is a reflection that every war is different from its predecessors, and that traditional combat skills still matter a great deal. But Mr. Berkowitz''s thesis does not allow much room for such nuance. In the end he strays uncomfortably close to technophilia and technological determinism rather than balanced strategic analysis.', '');

The president''s site went down, too, and soon so did those of several departments in a wired country that touts its paperless government and likes to call itself E-stonia.\r\nThen the attacks, coming in waves, began to strike newspapers and television stations, then schools and finally banks, raising fears that what was initially a nuisance could have economic consequences.\r\nThe attacks have peaked and tapered off since then, but they have not ended, prompting officials there to declare Estonia the first country to fall victim to a virtual war.\r\n''''If you have a missile attack against, let''s say, an airport, it is an act of war,'''' a spokesman for the Estonian Defense Ministry, Madis Mikko, said Friday in a telephone interview. ''''If the same result is caused by computers, then how else do you describe that kind of attack?''''\r\nOfficials in Estonia have accused Russia of orchestrating the attacks, officially or unofficially. They raised the issue at a meeting of NATO on Monday, with Defense Minister Jaak Aaviksoo saying that the alliance, which Estonia joined in 2004, needed to urgently debate the question -- once seemingly a distant threat -- of whether mass computer attacks posed a threat to national security.\r\n''''Events of this nature make a lot of people sit up,'''' a NATO spokesman, Robert Pszczel, said in a telephone interview. ''''Today Estonia, tomorrow it could be somebody else.''''\r\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly denied government involvement in the attacks, dismissing Estonia''s complaints as fabrications. Estonian officials, including Prime Minister Andrus Ansip, have said security officials traced the initial attacks to Russian computer servers, including domains registered to the government and the administration of President Vladimir V. Putin.\r\nSince those computers could be used by another party, it is unlikely that involvement of the Russian authorities can be proved, though an Estonian government spokesman, Martin Jasko, said the timing and targets raised suspicion enough.\r\nThe attacks began on the day that the Estonian authorities removed a Soviet-era war monument that had been the source of protests and diplomatic tensions with Russia for months. Russia reacted vehemently, accusing Estonia, a former republic of the Soviet Union, of besmirching the memory of Soviet soldiers who fought against Nazi Germany.\r\nIn the days that followed, Russia suspended rail service, ostensibly for track repairs, while protesters in Moscow staged raucous demonstrations, harassing Estonia''s ambassador in one instance. Senior officials have called for a boycott of Estonian goods, which at least one supermarket chain has observed.\r\nThe tensions with Estonia, along with Russian disputes with Poland and Lithuania, overshadowed a meeting in southern Russia near the city of Samara on Friday between Mr. Putin and the European Union''s leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the Union''s rotating president, and Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, the Union''s governing body.\r\nTensions between Russia and Estonia were discussed at the meeting, but the computer attacks were not, Taneli Lahti, a member of the European delegation, said in a telephone interview.\r\nEstonian officials assert that the cyberattack is the largest ever against a country. NATO, which itself came under a similar though smaller attack during its war against Serbia in 1999, sent a computer expert to Estonia this week to observe the attacks firsthand.\r\nThe computer attacks have inundated Estonia''s Web sites, overwhelming servers and forcing them to shut down, sometimes for a few hours, sometimes longer. Mr. Mikko, the Defense Ministry spokesman, said sites that typically received 1,000 visits a day had been buried under as many as 2,000 a second.\r\nThe attacks spiked on May 3, the day of the most boisterous protests in Moscow, and again on May 8 and 9, the days that Europe commemorates the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. For many Estonians the end of the war ushered in nearly five decades of Soviet occupation, and the monument was a symbol of it. Another spike in attacks occurred on Tuesday, forcing one of Estonia''s biggest banks to suspend access from abroad. Another bank faced an attack last week.\r\nAs the attacks have continued, they are now being traced to computers around the world, from Vietnam to the United States, according to Hillar Aarelaid, the head of the country''s newly created Computer Emergency Response Team.\r\nMr. Aarelaid said attacks involved ''''botnets,'''' networks of computers that have been compromised by an unauthorized user, who can then command and control them, surreptitiously and usually nefariously. Instructions in Russian on how to attack Estonian sites have circulated on the Internet, he added, suggesting that the world''s first cyberwar would continue.\r\n''''We can''t say we have seen the biggest attack yet,'''' he said, ''''because each wave is bigger than the one before.''''\r\n', '');

But the Director, John M. Deutch, said the nation''s intelligence agencies were alert to the threat of "very, very large" attacks on the computers that run Defense Department war rooms, power plants, telephone systems, air traffic control centers and international financial transfers.\r\n"The electron," Mr. Deutch warned, "is the ultimate precision-guided weapon."\r\nMr. Deutch said he was seeking to create a cyberwar center at the National Security Agency, the giant electronic eavesdropping branch of American intelligence. He said the center could focus the Government''s previously scattershot efforts to understand and combat the threats posed by governments, terrorist groups and mischievous teen-agers.\r\nMr. Deutch''s first public statement about information warfare came in testimony before Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who called a hearing of a Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee to discuss the little-understood, highly classified problem.\r\n"There are some who believe we are going to have to have an electronic Pearl Harbor, so to speak, before we really make this the kind of priority that many of us believe it deserves to be made," Mr. Nunn said. "Do you think we''re going to need that kind of real awakening, or are we fully alerted to this danger now?"\r\nMr. Deutch replied: "I think that we are fully alerted to it now. I don''t know whether we will face an electronic Pearl Harbor, but we will have, I''m sure, some very unpleasant circumstances."\r\nHe added, "I''m certainly prepared to predict some very, very large and uncomfortable incidents."\r\nMr. Deutch said cyberwar could become a 21st-century national security threat second only to nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.\r\nPotential attackers may already possess the sophisticated techniques they would need to bring off a cataclysmic crash, many experts believe, but they still lack the deep knowledge of their targets and direct access to the computer systems they would seek to disable.\r\nMilitary and civilian organizations are increasingly dependent on ever-more complicated and interlinked systems. They run the risk of understanding the threat less and less as it becomes more and more complex, Mr. Nunn and Mr. Deutch suggested.\r\nSenator Nunn also said intelligence agencies have communications problems with banks, telecommunications companies and other business ventures vulnerable to cyber attacks.\r\n"There''s a great reluctance by the private sector to discuss the threat that they''ve faced or even the attacks that have already occurred," he said, "because they fear that the word would go out they''re vulnerable, and therefore could destroy or damage consumer confidence and thereby cost them business."\r\n"At some point," the Senator added, "there''s got to be communication here."\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: June 26, 1996\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n', '');

After all, for people here the Internet is almost as vital as running water; it is used routinely to vote, file their taxes, and, with their cellphones, to shop or pay for parking.\r\nWhat followed was what some here describe as the first war in cyberspace, a monthlong campaign that has forced Estonian authorities to defend their pint-size Baltic nation from a data flood that they say was set off by orders from Russia or ethnic Russian sources in retaliation for the removal of the statue.\r\nThe Estonians assert that an Internet address involved in the attacks belonged to an official who works in the administration of Russia''s president, Vladimir V. Putin.\r\nThe Russian government has denied any involvement in the attacks, which came close to shutting down the country''s digital infrastructure, clogging the Web sites of the president, the prime minister, Parliament and other government agencies, staggering Estonia''s biggest bank and overwhelming the sites of several daily newspapers.\r\n''''It turned out to be a national security situation,'''' Estonia''s defense minister, Jaak Aaviksoo, said in an interview. ''''It can effectively be compared to when your ports are shut to the sea.''''\r\nComputer security experts from NATO, the European Union, the United States and Israel have since converged on Tallinn to offer help and to learn what they can about cyberwar in the digital age.\r\n''''This may well turn out to be a watershed in terms of widespread awareness of the vulnerability of modern society,'''' said Linton Wells II, the principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for networks and information integration at the Pentagon. ''''It has gotten the attention of a lot of people.''''\r\nThe authorities anticipated there would be a backlash to the removal of the statue, which had become a rallying point for Estonia''s large Russian-speaking minority, particularly as it was removed to a less accessible military graveyard.\r\nWhen the first digital intruders slipped into Estonian cyberspace at 10 p.m. on April 26, Mr. Aarelaid figured he was ready. He had erected firewalls around government Web sites, set up extra computer servers and put his staff on call for a busy week.\r\nBy April 29, Tallinn''s streets were calm again after two nights of riots caused by the statue''s removal, but Estonia''s electronic Maginot Line was crumbling. In one of the first strikes, a flood of junk messages was thrown at the e-mail server of the Parliament, shutting it down. In another, hackers broke into the Web site of the Reform Party, posting a fake letter of apology from the prime minister, Andrus Ansip, for ordering the removal of the highly symbolic statue.\r\nAt that point, Mr. Aarelaid, a former police officer, gathered security experts from Estonia''s Internet service providers, banks, government agencies and the police. He also drew on contacts in Finland, Germany, Slovenia and other countries to help him track down and block suspicious Internet addresses and halt traffic from computers as far away as Peru and China.\r\nThe bulk of the cyberassaults used a technique known as a distributed denial-of-service attack. By bombarding the country''s Web sites with data, attackers can clog not only the country''s servers, but also its routers and switches, the specialized devices that direct traffic on the network.\r\nTo magnify the assault, the hackers infiltrated computers around the world with software known as bots, and banded them together in networks to perform these incursions. The computers become unwitting foot soldiers, or ''''zombies,'''' in a cyberattack.\r\nIn one case, the attackers sent a single huge burst of data to measure the capacity of the network. Then, hours later, data from multiple sources flowed into the system, rapidly reaching the upper limit of the routers and switches.\r\nBy the end of the first week, the Estonians, with the help of authorities in other countries, had become reasonably adept at filtering out malicious data. Still, Mr. Aarelaid knew the worst was yet to come. May 9 was Victory Day, the Russian holiday that marks the Soviet Union''s defeat of Nazi Germany and honors fallen Red Army soldiers. The Internet was rife with plans to mark the occasion by taking down Estonia''s network.\r\nMr. Aarelaid huddled with security chiefs at the banks, urging them to keep their services running. He was also under orders to protect an important government briefing site. Other sites, like that of the Estonian president, were sacrificed as low priorities.\r\nThe attackers used a giant network of bots -- perhaps as many as one million computers in places as far away as the United States and Vietnam -- to amplify the impact of their assault. In a sign of their financial resources, there is evidence that they rented time on other so-called botnets.\r\n''''When you combine very, very large packets of information with thousands of machines, you''ve got the recipe for very damaging denial-of-service attacks,'''' said Jose Nazario, an expert on bots at Arbor Networks, an Internet security firm in Ann Arbor, Mich.\r\nIn the early hours of May 9, traffic spiked to thousands of times the normal flow. May 10 was heavier still, forcing Estonia''s biggest bank to shut down its online service for more than an hour. Even now, the bank, Hansabank, is under assault and continues to block access to 300 suspect Internet addresses. It has had losses of at least $1 million.\r\nFinally, on the afternoon of May 10, the attackers'' time on the rented servers expired, and the botnet attacks fell off abruptly.\r\nAll told, Arbor Networks measured dozens of attacks. The 10 largest assaults blasted streams of 90 megabits of data a second at Estonia''s networks, lasting up to 10 hours each. That is a data load equivalent to downloading the entire Windows XP operating system every six seconds for 10 hours.\r\n''''Hillar and his guys are good,'''' said Bill Woodcock, an American Internet security expert who was also on hand to observe the response. ''''There aren''t a lot of other countries that could combat that on his level of calm professionalism.''''\r\nEstonia''s defense was not flawless. To block hostile data, it had to close off large parts of its network to people outside the country.\r\n''''It is really a shame that an Estonian businessman traveling abroad does not have access to his bank account,'''' said Linnar Viik, a computer science professor and leader in Estonia''s high-tech industry. ''''For members of the Estonian Parliament, it meant four days without e-mail.''''\r\nStill, Mr. Viik said the episode would serve as a learning experience. The use of botnets, for example, illustrates how a cyberattack on a single country can ensnare many other countries.\r\nIn recent years, cyberattacks have been associated with Middle East and Serbian-Croatian conflicts. But computer systems at the Pentagon, NASA, universities and research labs have been compromised in the past.\r\nScientists and researchers convened by the National Academy of Sciences this year heard testimony from military strategy experts indicating that both China and Russia have offensive information-warfare programs. The United States is also said to have begun a cyberwarfare effort.\r\nThough Estonia cannot be sure of the attackers'' identities, their plans were posted on the Internet even before the attack began. On Russian-language forums and chat groups, the investigators found detailed instructions on how to send disruptive messages, and which Estonian Web sites to use as targets.\r\n''''We were watching them being set up in real time,'''' said Mr. Aarelaid, who weeks later could find several examples using Google.\r\nFor NATO, the attack may lead to a discussion of whether it needs to modify its commitment to collective defense, enshrined in Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty. Mr. Aarelaid said NATO''s Internet security experts said little but took copious notes during their visit.\r\nBecause of the murkiness of the Internet -- where attackers can mask their identities by using the Internet addresses of others, or remotely program distant computers to send data without their owners even knowing it -- several experts said that the attackers would probably never be caught. American government officials said that the nature of the attacks suggested they were initiated by ''''hacktivists,'''' technical experts who act independently from governments.\r\n''''At the present time, we are not able to prove direct state links,'''' Mr. Aaviksoo, Estonia''s defense minister, said. ''''All we can say is that a server in our president''s office got a query from an I.P. address in the Russian administration,'''' he added, using the abbreviation for Internet protocol. Moscow had offered no help in tracking down people who the Estonian government believes may be involved.\r\nA spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitri S. Peskov, denied Russian state involvement in the attacks and added, ''''The Estonia side has to be extremely careful when making accusations.''''\r\nThe police here arrested and then released a 19-year-old Estonian man of Russian descent whom they suspected of helping to organize the attacks. Meanwhile, Estonia''s foreign ministry has circulated a document that lists several Internet addresses inside the Russian government that it said took part in the attacks.\r\n''''I don''t think it was Russia, but who can tell?'''' said Gadi Evron, a computer security expert from Israel who spent four days in Tallinn writing a post-mortem on the response for the Estonians.

The dispute began last month when Microsoft introduced a clone of the AOL Instant Messenger program, which permits computer users to chat over the Internet with other computer users.\r\nSince Microsoft released its clone, the two companies have waged a public war of words while simultaneously carrying on a hacking cyberwar as America Online has tried to electronically lock Microsoft Messenger users out of its network and Microsoft has at least 13 times managed to find new backdoors.\r\nAmerica Online executives say Microsoft is making illegal use of proprietary directory information that is essential to connect instant messenger users via the Internet.\r\nThe Microsoft disinformation incident came to light on Wednesday when Richard Smith, the president of Phar Lap Software and a leading computer security expert, received an E-mail message from someone identifying himself as Phil Bucking of Bucking Consulting.\r\nThe author suggested that he was developing his own instant messaging program and was studying America Online''s tactics in blocking Microsoft users. In his message, he asserted that America Online is using a programming error that has created a security flaw -- one not found in Microsoft''s clone program -- to detect the Microsoft Messenger program. The author said he was writing Mr. Smith because Mr. Smith had "significant credibility with the press."\r\n"I think you would agree that this is a heinous and risky action," stated the electronic message, which was sent using a free Yahoo E-mail account. "I am perfectly fine with AOL and MS fighting it out with standard software practices, but putting user security at risk is unacceptable. It is inconceivable that a company would even consider doing this."\r\nWhen Mr. Smith, who has criticized Microsoft''s software development and privacy practices in the past, examined the message, he discovered that it had originated within Microsoft.\r\n"Microsoft is trying to use me as a pawn in their fight with AOL," he said.\r\nIn a telephone interview today, Rob Bennett, the director of marketing for Microsoft''s Internet service, MSN, confirmed that the author of the message was almost certainly a Microsoft employee, but he said the company had not yet discovered his or her identity.\r\n"I think it''s somebody who got a little overpassionate but went about it the wrong way," Mr. Bennett said.\r\nComputer industry analysts said that the incident echoed a 1992 controversy in which Microsoft employees masqueraded as independent computer users and posted messages to public computer bulletin boards with opinions critical of I.B.M.''s OS/2 operating system, a product that competed with Microsoft''s Windows.\r\n"This is par for the course for Microsoft marketing," said John C. Dvorak, a columnist for PC Magazine. "In the past we called them Microsoft munchkins. It was a scandal."\r\nMicrosoft executives said there had been no Microsoft plan to play dirty tricks in its dispute with America Online. Mr. Bennett also said that members of Microsoft''s software development team had told him they knew nothing about the incident.\r\nMr. Bennett, however, insisted that the accusations made in the message were accurate and that America Online''s programmers had been exploiting a security flaw in the AOL Instant Messenger software to identify Microsoft Messenger customers. He said that since the dispute began, , Microsoft had made 13 changes to its program to get around America Online''s efforts to block users of Microsoft''s clone.\r\n"It''s unfortunate they''re putting user security at risk," he said.\r\nAn America Online executive disputed that there was any security issue involved and said the company would not acknowledge that its software contained a vulnerability known as a buffer-overflow error.\r\n"It''s a fake issue by a fake consultant, " said Barry Schuller, director of interactive services at America Online. "Our whole approach is all about privacy and security for our members, and I think this is really embarrassing for Microsoft."\r\nA buffer overflow error is a type of programming defect that could permit an intruder to execute rogue programming instructions on a remote machine via a computer network. In some cases buffer overflow bugs can be exploited to crash remote programs while simultaneously executing illicit code.\r\nMicrosoft said that in the case of AOL Instant Messenger, the buffer overflow error did not result in a program crash. But by running a program on its servers, America Online could exploit the bug by weeding out users whose software did not have the error and therefore had to be using the Microsoft clone.\r\nMr. Smith acknowledged that the code Microsoft was questioning in America Online''s program might not, in fact, be a bug. But if it was, he said, America Online''s exploiting it to detect the Microsoft clone was risky from the standpoints of privacy and computer security.\r\n"Putting network backdoors in software products should be against the law," he said. "I don''t like the idea at all of ''spyware.'' "\r\nMicrosoft posted a change to its program last night to work around the new America Online strategy, Mr. Bennett said. But he added that the workaround did not use a buffer overflow error.\r\nSeparately, AOL and the Novell Corporation announced yesterday that Novell, a software provider in Provo, Utah, had licensed the AOL Instant Messenger software.  \r\n', '');

Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\r\nThe cyberwarfare center will take over what is now a scattered series of operations and will have headquarters at the Space Command in Colorado Springs under Gen. Richard Myers of the Air Force.\r\nGeneral Shelton officially confirmed today that the United States tried to mount electronic attacks into Serbian computer networks throughout the air campaign over Kosovo. "We only used our capability to a very limited degree," he said.\r\nGovernment officials disclosed over the summer that United States intelligence was mounting computer attacks on foreign bank accounts held by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and other Serbian leaders, with the goal being to drain assets or alter banking records.\r\nIn future wars, United States cyberwarriors will try to disable air defense systems, upset logistics and infect software through advances made by the Colorado center, according to a Pentagon official.\r\nAt ceremonies here, Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr. was put in charge of another new center, where the job is to coordinate military actions should an enemy target this country with biological, chemical or nuclear weapons.\r\nThe idea has been criticized strongly by civil libertarians who argue that any homeland defense plan might open the door for the military to assume the role of domestic police, which is prohibited by law.\r\nSecretary of Defense William S. Cohen described both centers as answers to the newest threats facing the United States.\r\nSaying the United States must be prepared to fight the full range of modern warfare, Mr. Cohen said the joint task force to coordinate military actions would be ready to respond in the event of an attack on American soil, but under the direction of a civilian agency like the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\r\n"We are stepping into the future, to deal with the kind of threats we are likely to face from chemical biological and even nuclear weapons," Mr. Cohen said.\r\nBut officials of civil liberties organizations said they were wary. "Our concern is that there be a bright line drawn between law enforcement and the military," Gregory Nojeim of the American Civil Liberties Union said.\r\n"This not only blurs that bright line but virtually guarantees further involvement of the military in civilian law-enforcement activity."\r\nIn an interview with The New York Times last year, President Clinton voiced support for such a task force to strengthen the nation''s defenses against new kinds of terrorism. "What I want us to do is everything within reason we can to minimize our exposure and risks here," Mr. Clinton said.\r\nIn the past several years, Mr. Clinton has highlighted his fears of the growing threat from cyberwarfare and of terrorists using weapons of mass destruction in the United States. He approved these new changes made by the Pentagon''s top officials as part of a routine revision of the responsibilities and roles of its nine commands scattered across the globe.\r\nAs part of those changes the Atlantic Command here will now be known as the Joint Forces Command, to reflect new responsibilities to train and create doctrines for the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines in joint operations.\r\nBut the new cybercenter in Colorado is to have far-ranging responsibilities in future wars, according to General Shelton, who said that the Pentagon detected efforts to enter its computers by unauthorized people in the Kosovo campaign.\r\n"During Kosovo, there is no question that day in and day out we got hundreds if not thousands of hits," he said, saying that the United States classified computer systems were well protected.\r\nBut he wants the new center to figure out how to improve the protection for both classified and unclassified computer systems. The Pentagon uses unclassified computer networks for what are routine but sometimes sensitive transactions.\r\n"When you''re dealing with a military operation you can''t afford to have anybody break into your system," General Shelton said.\r\n"In the last five years we have certainly seen a proliferation of information warfare organizations, and if this new center will put all the focus and energies of the military in one place, then it is a big deal," said William Arkin, an expert on cyberwarfare.\r\n', '');

His proposals included a pay increase for the military, deployment of a national missile defense system and elimination of outmoded weapons systems.\r\n"Today, my friends, we must face a harsh and compelling reality," Mr. McCain said last night after receiving an annual freedom award at the U.S.S. Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum in Manhattan. "In strategy, personnel and procurement -- the total package that defines America''s ability to defend itself -- the United States does not have the modern force and defense posture we must have to meet the threats to America''s interests and values in the 21st century."\r\nAs a young naval aviator, Mr. McCain served on the Intrepid.\r\nIn a sharp criticism of the Clinton administration''s military policy, Mr. McCain also said: "It''s time to end the disingenuous practice of stating that we have a two-war strategy when we are paying for only a one-war military. Either we must change our strategy -- and accept the risks -- or we must properly fund and structure our military."\r\nMr. McCain, who was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five and a half years and was in the Navy for 22 years, set out proposals to increase military morale and to reshape the nation''s armed forces for challenges that he said often required lighter, more flexible special forces instead of a conventional military geared toward war in Central Europe.\r\nHe called for a 3 percent-a-year pay increase for military personnel across three years and the elimination of federal taxes on military personnel based overseas. Aides said the raise would cost $4.3 billion over three years, while the tax proposal would cost $800 million a year.\r\nMr. McCain also said he could identify ways to save $20 billion in Pentagon spending through steps like eliminating pork barrel spending, closing unneeded bases, privatizing some support and maintenance functions and eliminating "Buy America" restrictions. In New Hampshire, where he previewed some of his remarks before a Rotary Club, Mr. McCain listed the C-130 aircraft, the B-2 bomber and the Seawolf submarine as examples of weapons systems that were no longer necessary.\r\nThe senator''s aides said savings across all these areas would come close to offsetting Mr. McCain''s military spending proposals.\r\nThe address on national security policy was the first of several speeches Mr. McCain plans over the next few weeks on health care, the environment and Social Security. Polls show the senator running neck and neck with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in the first primary state, New Hampshire.\r\nThe senator has been using his gripping personal story and his expertise in foreign policy to set himself apart from Mr. Bush. But his military policy was not strikingly different from Mr. Bush''s own call in September for the nation to adapt to new security challenges in the aftermath of the cold war.\r\nMr. McCain said the threats to the nation''s strategic interests had evolved since the cold war, although he still cited as potential threats the political and economic chaos in Russia and China''s growing military and economic might. He said the United States faced national security challenges from nationalist and ethnic conflicts, from the possibility of attacks on vital links like computer grids, from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in rogue states and from terrorism.\r\nBy the coming decade, he said, the United States could face "a fundamentally new strategic situation: a rogue state such as Iraq or North Korea, with the ability, in time of crisis to use nuclear blackmail against an American president." He called for a policy of "rogue state rollback," not simply to contain such governments but to drive them from power by helping opposition groups.\r\nMr. McCain said a system to shield against ballistic missiles was an "indispensable defense" against rogue states. As president, he said, he would try to negotiate a pact with Russia to alter the 1972 ABM treaty with the Soviet Union to allow such a missile defense shield. But if Russia does not agree, he said, "I will withdraw from a treaty that has become a relic of the cold war if it cannot be made relevant to our national security needs."\r\nHe said, "Our cold war pledge to remain defenseless against missile attack is the single greatest incentive for rogue statue proliferation."\r\nMr. Bush has made a similar pledge to break out of the treaty if Russia does not agree to make changes. And the Clinton administration, in softer terms, has raised the possibility.\r\nMr. McCain said the Pentagon needed to reassess the goals and mission of each of the nation''s military services for a time when the nation''s forces needed to be smaller, more automated and easier to deploy. Re-evaluating readiness will be a waste if it is intended only to hide a lack of political will to provide a superpower defense for a superpower''s commitments, he said. "We should never ask how much defense we can afford, my friends," he said.\r\nBlaming both President Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. McCain issued a scathing critique of current military readiness. He said that during the war in Kosovo last spring, the Army was "unable to deploy its premier Apache helicopter forces in time to play a vital role." He also noted that the the Air Force''s inventory of air-launched cruise missiles fell to 70 from the 1,000 level the Pentagon says it needs to handle two major theater wars.\r\nAnd he said reductions in the United States'' carrier fleet "could have resulted in a calamity in the Pacific" earlier this year when deployments in Kosovo and the Persian Gulf left "no carrier battle groups in East Asia''s waters, where events in the Straits of Taiwan and on the Korean Peninsula could have become world threatening crises."\r\n \r\nIn His Own Words: JOHN McCAIN\r\n \r\nRemarks about defense policy prepared for delivery here last night aboard the aircraft carrier Intrepid:\r\n"I have spoken before about the unique ''unipolar moment'' in world affairs for the United States and the necessity to extend this period of American pre-eminence for as long as we possibly can. In a remarkably changed world, and on the eve of the next American century, our core strategic interests, like our founding ideals, remain constant: protecting our homeland and hemisphere from external threats; preventing the domination of Europe by a single power; strengthening our alliances; securing access to energy resources; and sustaining stability in the Pacific Rim. With the end of the cold war, the threats to our strategic interests have evolved or, at least, their ranking as priority threats has been reordered.\r\nIn addition to the potential threats posed by continued political and economic chaos in Russia, and China''s growing economic and military strength, there are other immediate threats to our national security that the next administration must face. Recently, I described these four threats in detail.\r\nFirst, violent expressions of nationalist and ethnic rivalries;\r\nSecond, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to rogue states and potential adversaries;\r\nThird, information warfare such as an attack on our private sector''s computer grids that cause critical failures in vital services that we take for granted. If we do not more effectively guard our communications, including the Internet -- our powerful economic engine -- utilities, transportation, financial systems, and other essential services, tiny fiber optic threads might carry viruses as incapacitating as an armed attack.\r\nFourth, and directly connected to cyberwarfare and proliferation, terrorism.\r\nThere is a common identity to many of these threats. It should surprise no one that the most viciously antidemocratic regimes, the rogue states, are the chief proliferators; the major exporters of terrorism; the main instigators of regional and ethnic conflicts. From the Persian Gulf to the Korean Peninsula to the Balkans, rogue states are the main threat to peace and freedom, and they require a strong, comprehensive policy response, a policy of ''rogue state rollback.''\r\nWe must use both public and private diplomacy, targeted economic measures, and military assistance to aid forces seeking freedom from rogue regimes. But we must be prepared to back up these measures with American military force when the continued existence of such rogue states threatens America''s interests and values. And, most importantly, state sponsors of terrorism must know not the specifics of our response, but the certainty that it will be swift and sure."', '');

Gen. Robert H. Scales Jr. regularly leads students, politicians, foreign officers and other visitors on tours through the landmarks of the battlefield here: Devil''s Den, Little Round Top, Cemetery Ridge. Though the Battle of Gettysburg was fought 136 years ago, General Scales thinks it still offers lessons on the art of war. At the same time, it is getting harder and harder to see them.\r\nTechnology has depersonalized modern warfare, making the brutality and concentrated carnage of Gettysburg -- where 51,000 soldiers were killed, wounded or left missing in action in just three days of head-to-head fighting -- almost unthinkable. Paradoxically, that same technology has made killing easier than ever.\r\nNow, the very idea of war, and those who fight it, is being transformed at a pace unfathomable even a few years ago. "You''re trying to conjure up a kind of war we have never fought before," said General Scales, who is widely viewed as one of the Army''s leading visionaries.\r\nWith laser-guided missiles and long-range weapons allowing battles to be fought at greater distances with greater firepower, the likelihood of vast armies arrayed against each other has essentially vanished. Most military strategists think that the Persian Gulf war -- in which the United States assembled a coalition of 500,000 troops to repel Iraq''s invasion of Kuwait in 1991 -- was a last gasp of the old way, despite all the high-technology weaponry that the war introduced to the world. In the last 18 months, the Clinton administration has struck Sudan and Afghanistan, launched raids against Iraq and, with NATO, waged war over Kosovo, all without putting a single American soldier on the ground.\r\nThe military lessons of Gettysburg -- protecting your flank, holding the high ground -- will be irrelevant in a future in which front lines no longer exist. With satellites providing instantaneous information and bombs and missiles able to strike from afar, massing troops or seizing high ground simply makes a riper target for jets flying thousands of feet overhead.\r\nThis is more than the triumph of air power. New technologies are transforming the battlefield of the future on the ground, too. The Marine Corps is already testing small, insectlike robots that can act as sensors on the battlefield, probing deep into the enemy''s territory without the risks that reconnaissance squads face. Over the next couple of decades, the Army plans to create "digitized" units tied into a global communications network using satellites, unmanned drones and sensors on the ground.\r\nImagine front-line troops able to send and receive orders, target coordinates and intelligence reports through eyepieces and microcomputers built into their belts or buttons. "If you think of the soldier on the battlefield as a pawn, we can make them all knights," said Ellison C. Urban, deputy director of the Army office trying to develop these microsystems.\r\nIt took 90,000 Union troops to defend the few square miles around Gettysburg. Today, the Army could hold them with 700 to 800 soldiers, maybe even 100. Some analysts envision in the future an "empty battlefield," where armies wrestle for control of territory without ever seeing the enemy.\r\nWith its vast superiority in weapons, the United States may not be fighting armies at all, but thugs, terrorists and mobs in limited conflicts or "operations other than war" like peacekeeping and drug interdiction.\r\nCharles C. Moskos, a military sociologist at Northwestern University, says this will blur not only the front lines but also the divisions between society and its military. The American military will rely more heavily on civilian contractors while facing social pressures to integrate women and gay men and lesbians. He calls it the Postmodern Military.\r\nSoldiers will need technical prowess more than raw physical strength. They will be older, more mature, infinitely better trained. "The days of the 18-year-old infantryman are over," General Scales said.\r\nInstead, soldiers will be a professional cadre -- and an ever-smaller minority in a military dominated by people sitting in front of computer screens.\r\nSome see danger in this. "It has always been seen that the professional military class is antithetical to a free society," said John Hillen, a former Army tank commander who is now a military affairs analyst.\r\nTaken to an extreme, the trends in technology raise the question of whether the military will need boot-on-the-ground combat troops at all. Is it possible to defend the nation''s security without ever having to ask its young people to die for the cause?\r\nFor politicians, the idea will be enticing, but most military analysts warn against an overreliance on technology. For General Scales, this may be the lasting lesson of Gettysburg: wars are still fought and won by individuals, acting with courage, leadership and initiative. Huva Wass de Czege, a retired brigadier general, put it another way. War, he said, is a moral question, forcing a country to decide whether it is prepared to sacrifice its people for its interests. "If it''s just a machine against a machine," he said, "what''s the point?"\r\n  \r\n', '');

The group spent much of Wednesday night and Thursday morning contacting those on the list to warn them to look for unauthorized charges on their cards and to take precautions against computer viruses that might be sent to them by e-mail. It also shut down access to its site at www.aipac.org.\r\nThe group named in the manifesto, the Pakistan Hackerz Club, is known in hacker circles for an unusual blend of political activism and Web site vandalism, said B. K. DeLong, who works with attrition.org, a nonprofit Web site that monitors hacking activity.\r\nIn an e-mail message claiming responsibility for the attack on behalf of the hackers'' group, an individual identifying himself as Doctor Nuker said he was motivated by his anger over the Middle East conflict and by what he called lies on the lobbying group''s Web site.\r\nSaying his group was formed "to hack for the injustice going around the globe, especially with Muslims," he added: "Aipac is not the end. I''m going to hack more sites of this sort and will sure do the maximum damage I can!"\r\nAttrition.org said the group''s previous exploits included attacks on Web sites of the United States Mission to the United Nations, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in Britain and a United Nations site in India.\r\nThe attackers often refer to the conflict in Kashmir and include an animated message that reads "Kashmir is burning -- time is running out."\r\nKenneth Bricker, a spokesman for the lobbying organization, said that the hacker was able to gather the names, Internet addresses and telephone and credit card numbers only from those people who had contacted Aipac through its Web site. The broader list of the organization''s 55,000 members, which he referred to as "the crown jewels of Aipac," are stored on a separate computer system "that was never compromised, never at risk," he said.\r\nThe list of names included the famous and the unknown; former Senator Rudy Boschwitz, a Minnesota Republican, and members of his family were there, along with their credit card numbers. (Mr. Boschwitz was traveling yesterday, but an employee said that he had immediately canceled the cards.)\r\nMatt Rosenberg, a certified public accountant in Woodland Hills, Calif., said he had been contacted by the group and was watching his credit card account for unusual activity. "It''s not the end of the world," he said, but "it means there are some not good people out there."\r\nEugene Spafford, a computer security expert who runs the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security at Purdue University, said cyberattacks had begun to arise wherever disputes occur, whether it is the Balkans, Russia, Mexico or China. But he said they had been especially prominent in the recent troubles in Israel. "It''s a war of words and ideas as well as rocks and rubber bullets," he said.\r\nIn recent weeks, Web sites based throughout the Middle East have been altered with messages advocating online attacks against Israeli and pro-Palestinian Web sites. Cyberwarriors have attacked sites linked to both sides of the conflict by flooding them with e-mail or staging "denial of service" attacks, which involve jamming a Web site with so much traffic that access is blocked to all others. Among the targets in Israel have been the Web sites of the foreign ministry, the defense force, the prime minister''s office and the treasury; the pro-Palestinian sites attacked include that of the guerrilla group Hezbollah.\r\nIn the Aipac case, the anti-Israeli manifesto appeared on the Web site for less than 15 minutes before the organization blocked access, but it soon reappeared on other sites, known as mirrors, that monitor and preserve hacked pages.\r\nAccording to information on Doctor Nuker''s personal Web page, where the credit card data was published, he is Pakistani and a part-time model. His site includes political commentary, hacking tools and song lyrics by such artists as Metallica and Christina Aguilera. He sent his e-mail through a free Internet mail service, Puckoff.com, based in Buffalo.\r\nBy 5:15 p.m. yesterday, the material had been taken down by NBC Internet, which offers tools for users to create free Web pages on its site. "We believe that there were multiple violations of our terms of service with this particular Web site and it has now been removed," said Robert Silverman, a spokesman for the company, which is the online arm of the NBC television network. "We will cooperate with the proper authorities" in their investigation, he said.\r\nLast night, the Aipac site was still unreachable, and Mr. Bricker said the group would not bring it back into service until it had completed a thorough investigation and had taken new protective measures. "Until that is finished, there''s no point in putting it back up," he said. "You never know where Doctor Nuker will strike next."\r\nThe incident has caused the organization to rethink its strategy on the Internet and "how much it can be relied upon," Mr. Bricker said.\r\n"All this is new to us," he added, "but we''re certainly getting a crash lesson."\r\n  ', '');

But he gave only a broad hint of how that office might work.\r\nEmpowered by its proximity to the president rather than actual legal authority, the office is intended to "coordinate activities, to make sure that anybody who wants to harm America will have a hard time doing so," President Bush said today.\r\nTonight''s announcement reflects a desire to give Mr. Ridge, as homeland security adviser, the power to coordinate federal agencies at the highest level and to have some authority, as yet undetermined, over their budgets, Mr. Card said.\r\nMembers of Congress have praised the homeland security initiative but have voiced concern that Mr. Ridge would lack the power needed to pull together elements of the 46 separate agencies and departments that will be part of the new effort.\r\nPresident Bush''s top advisers heard some concerns in meetings with Congressional leaders. Mr. Card said that when filling out the details of this new council, the president had taken into account that the government had a "good track record on reacting to emergencies."\r\n"But in intelligence gathering, prevention and defense it''s been less good," he said.\r\nMr. Ridge is charged with managing the diverse and sometimes warring agencies that were in charge during period when the Sept. 11 terrorists entered the United States with ease and carried out their plot undetected.\r\nThe new council will be paid for with White House money. There will be no Congressional oversight and confirmation by the Senate for Mr. Ridge will not be required.\r\nThe various agencies and departments that will report to Governor Ridge could be compared to 46 different and sometimes incompatible computer systems. Their lack of connectivity means there is no national 911 number. Governor Ridge and two other White House officials will be charged with bringing together all the available intelligence and all the services necessary to respond to an emergency or an attack.\r\n"Almost every one of the agencies that has to join the fight here has woefully inadequate business practices to share information," said John J. Hamre, the former deputy secretary of defense. "Invariably they have 35- to 40-year-old reporting requirements that are still paper-bound. Now, in this kind of era, that''s just unacceptable."\r\nWhite House officials have also decided to create a homeland defense command within the military despite years of criticism from civil rights groups that a military assigned to protect the country could easily be transformed into a super police force.\r\nThe Joint Forces Command in Norfolk, Va., is one obvious choice, according to defense officials involved in the planning. The command could also be shared with the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado.\r\nWith the heightened fear of a bio-chemical attack, Mr. Ridge''s office will also include experts in bio-defense from the Department of Health and Human Service, who have already been notified of their new positions. They will supervise the vaccines and antibiotic stockpiles now managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, official said.\r\nCounterterrorism would be reorganized under Governor Ridge''s office. Richard A. Clarke, counterterrorism czar at the White House for the last 11 years, will be put in charge of the new Office of Cyber Security, according to officials involved in the planning.\r\nGov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia, chairman of a federal panel on terrorism, is among several senior officials who question whether billions for counterterrorism are being well spent.\r\nGovernor Gilmore said the government was spending $10.4 billion for the purpose. Of that, he said, about $800 million goes to readiness and response. And of that, $300 million goes to states and local governments -- "in a crisis, the first responders, as we have seen in both New York and in Virginia," Mr. Gilmore said.\r\nMr. Card said that "the first responders are very important" and that state and local governments would be represented in some form on the Homeland Security Council.\r\nSince May 1998, under secret directives issued by the Clinton White House, Mr. Clarke has been in charge of coordinating counterterrorism plans, defending against computer attacks, protecting civilians against biological attacks and stockpiling vaccines.\r\nAlthough the government made progress in the cyberwar field, aided by billions of dollars invested in solving the Year 2000 computer problem, all involved say that efforts to harmonize the federal, state and local responses of terrorist threats have often been discordant.\r\nMr. Clarke, like Mr. Ridge, on paper had the power to cut through bureaucratic walls and break down jurisdictional boxes. But the task was difficult. In a 1999 interview, he said: "There is a problem convincing people that there is a threat. There is disbelief and resistance. Most people don''t understand."\r\n', '');

Any changes would be subject to Congressional approval.\r\nThe general, Ralph E. Eberhart of the Air Force, said he had no specific changes in mind, but added in an interview here, "We should always be reviewing things like Posse Comitatus and other laws if we think it ties our hands in protecting the American people."\r\nThe willingness of General Eberhart and some other senior officers to consider amending the post-Reconstruction law is a shift in thinking by many top Pentagon officials, who have traditionally been wary of involving the military in domestic law enforcement.\r\nMilitary leaders have generally supported the restrictions because their troops were not specifically trained in those roles, and they worried that domestic tasks could lead to serious political problems.\r\nBut in the aftermath of Sept. 11, some Pentagon officials and military officers are beginning to say that the law, as it stands, may slow or complicate their domestic defense missions.\r\nSome military officials fear that without additional authority to operate in the United States, they could be blamed for failures without adequate ability to prevent them. But other Pentagon officials continue to contend that accepting greater domestic responsibilities is risky, and that any proposed changes should receive careful public scrutiny.\r\nAll of this reflects the larger national debate over how best to protect Americans from terrorist attacks.\r\nAs recently as May, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said the Pentagon would not seek any changes in the law, and the legal review contained in President Bush''s new plan for domestic security announced this week surprised many senior officers and Pentagon officials.\r\nBut White House officials insisted that administration lawyers review the law to determine whether domestic preparedness and response efforts would benefit from greater involvement of military personnel, reflecting tension between some at the Pentagon and the Office of Homeland Security.\r\n"This was their initiative, not ours," said one senior Defense Department official.\r\nAt the same time, however, other senior military officials -- including General Eberhart -- said the review made sense. The general finds himself in the delicate position of balancing the wariness of his bosses at the Pentagon with his own responsibilities as the leader of the military''s new Northern Command, where he will presumably want as much flexibility as possible to carry out his mission.\r\nOther commanders are asking similar questions as the military develops expertise in areas, like information operations and cyberwarfare, that could support domestic law enforcement agencies. Such support is now barred by law, defense officials said.\r\nNo one is sure what additional responsibilities the military might take on if the law is revised. White House and Pentagon officials said several incidents since Sept. 11 illustrate why changes may be needed.\r\nWhen National Guard troops were deployed on the Canadian border after Sept. 11 to support Border Patrol and Customs agents, the Posse Comitatus law prevented those troops from conducting surveillance from the helicopters that flew them to their assignment.\r\nAdministration lawyers determined that President Bush would violate Posse Comitatus if he called up National Guard troops to help provide security at airports nationwide. So Mr. Bush had to ask governors to use their call-up authority to perform the same task.\r\n"We think a review is necessary to streamline interpretations of some existing laws," said Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security.\r\nThe Posse Comitatus Act was enacted after the Civil War in response to the perceived misuse of federal troops who were charged with domestic law enforcement in the South. But it has come to symbolize the separation of civilian affairs from military influence.\r\nPosse Comitatus restricts military forces from performing domestic law enforcement duties, like policing. Over the years, the law has been amended to allow the military to lend equipment to federal, state and local authorities; assist federal agencies in drug interdiction work; protect national parks; and execute quarantine and certain health laws. About 5,000 federal troops supported civilian agencies at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City this year.\r\n"My view has been that Posse Comitatus will constantly be under review as we mature this command, as we do our exercises, as we interact with FEMA, F.B.I., and those lead federal agencies out there," said General Eberhart, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\r\nThe Northern Command, which begins operations here on Oct. 1, will be in charge of all military personnel involved in flying patrols over American cities, guarding the waters up to 500 miles off the United States coast, and responding to major terrorist attacks.\r\nIn his vision for the new command, General Eberhart said the military could use new technology, like remote-controlled surveillance blimps operating at 70,000 feet and unmanned Predator drones that would patrol American coastlines.\r\nThe general said it was also possible that the North American Aerospace Defense Command, known as Norad, might expand beyond the United States and Canada to include Mexico, or that the United States might form a separate joint defense command with Mexico.\r\n"To defend this nation, we have to defend as far out as possible," General Eberhart said. "Therefore we need the support of Canada and Mexico to be able to defend our interests."\r\nThe Northern Command will unify a range of domestic security duties now spread over several military units and services.\r\nGeneral Eberhart, who will also remain leader of Norad, will be responsible in his new job for coordinating the military''s response to natural disasters like floods, hurricanes and forest fires, officials said.\r\nThe new command would also oversee a unit known as the Joint Task Force Civil Support, which is trained to respond to attacks that involve chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.\r\nWhile the command will have specific defensive responsibilities, like flying combat patrols over American cities, General Eberhart''s mission will also involve the delicate task of backing up civilian agencies in time of need.\r\n"We will respond in support of a lead federal agency, such as the F.B.I. or FEMA," he said. "There will be certain things you can do with federal troops and certain things you cannot. There are some situations where there''s no other alternatives, and federal forces have to be used to secure the safety and security of our people."\r\nMr. Rumsfeld and Gen. Richard B. Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have said that in a catastrophe, the military might help quarantine disaster victims and deal with the water and sanitation needs of thousands of people.\r\n"If a city had no ability to respond and no ability to command and control, there''s a situation where the president says: ''This is an emergency. Northern Command, you have the lead,'' " General Eberhart said. "God forbid, we''d be prepared to do that."\r\n', '');

Experts say the link between Iraq and computer hacking may have been underestimated and poses a growing threat to United States security.\r\n"Iraq is certainly among the places in the world that we think a cyberattack might well be launched from," Representative Robert E. Andrews of New Jersey, a Democrat on the House Armed Service Committee who has been active on cyberwarfare issues, said in an interview.\r\nMr. Andrews noted that computer attacks were difficult to trace and could be damaging, which he said met Iraq''s goals. "A cyberattack really fits Saddam Hussein''s paradigm for attacking us," he said.\r\nNo one appears to have been arrested in the attacks, and the F.B.I. assessment did not divulge the number of recent hackings or how successful they were. Nor did it disclose how the authorities traced the motive or origin of the attacks, but it blamed "ideologically motivated, pro-Iraq" hackers who have expressed opposition to United States activities in the Middle East and support for Islamic extremists.\r\nThere is some skepticism over whether Mr. Hussein''s regime has the technical capability or the desire to initiate such attacks.\r\nGordon Johndroe, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said, "We are concerned about groups sympathetic to Iraq" hacking into government computer systems. But he added that there was no evidence that Mr. Hussein''s regime had done so.\r\n"I wouldn''t tie this in to a state-run operation," Mr. Johndroe said. "Iraq is more interested in obtaining weapons of mass destruction -- chemical, biological and nuclear -- than in pursuing the sophisticated skills and equipment necessary for a successful cyberattack."\r\nOfficials at Iraq''s mission to the United Nations did not return phone calls seeking comment.\r\nMilitary and F.B.I. officials declined to discuss the Iraq issue specifically. In a statement, the bureau acknowledged that in general, as international tensions increase, cybercrime "often escalates."\r\n"It can be state sponsored or encouraged, or come from domestic organizations or individuals independently," the statement said.\r\nThe military said it worked constantly to prevent hacking at the 3 million computers and 10,000 local area networks in its information infrastructure.\r\n"The fact is, we are attacked and we defend on a daily basis," said Tim Madden, a spokesman for Maj. Gen. J. David Bryan, commander of the military''s Joint Task Force-Computer Network Operations.\r\nMr. Madden said, "Less than 2 percent of those attacks are successful in that the intruders gained root-level access."\r\nBut American military analysts have become so concerned about the recent increase in activity that last week they raised the alert status on the threat of pro-Iraqi hackers to the level of a "possible crisis," the F.B.I. assessment said. Military officials declined to explain how the threat system works or the reasons any changes might be made.\r\nThe assessment said recent computer disruptions have included Web defacements, "denial of service" attacks that can disrupt or paralyze a network, and hacking "probes" and "scans" aimed at testing the vulnerability of a network.\r\nThe F.B.I.''s assessment described these recent disruptions as relatively low level. But it warned that as tensions with Iraq escalated, "more dangerous courses of action" by Iraqi-affiliated hackers -- including more widespread denial-of-service attacks and the injection of worms or viruses that can damage programs -- were "increasingly possible."\r\nThe F.B.I. predicted that "hacking activity will continue during the next 90 days and will increase as allied pressure on Iraq mounts."\r\nThe report said hacker groups controlled hundreds of automated search robot networks that could be used to attack government systems. And it warned that many powerful, easy-to-use tools were available on public Internet sites.\r\nMichael Vatis, former director of the F.B.I. cybercrime unit, said even relatively unsophisticated hackers could significantly damage systems that control a wide range of national security interests.\r\nIraq is thought to have been developing an information warfare program in recent years, but it is probably lagging behind more sophisticated countries like China and Russia, said Mr. Vatis, who is now director of the Institute for Security Technology Studies at Dartmouth College.\r\n"I would suspect they''re at a middling stage," he said. "But even a middling capability can cause serious harm."\r\nMr. Vatis cautioned that tracing an electronic attack is a notoriously difficult task. In the case of denial-of-service attacks, hackers can hide their identities by penetrating hundreds of computer networks and turning them into "zombies" to use against a target system, he said.\r\nHe pointed to an episode in 1998 in which hackers penetrated United States military computers and briefly disrupted troop exercises in the Persian Gulf. The authorities originally suspected Iraqi agents, but they ultimately traced the attack to two California teenagers.\r\n"You can''t assume that your military adversary is responsible," Mr. Vatis said.', '');

The enemy and the targets are generally identifiable. But in the war against hackers and virus writers, the combatants are harder to know.\r\nThe attacker might be a 14-year-old in Canada, or a co-worker in the accounting department. "You''ll have every type of person" practicing the dark arts of programming, said Sarah Gordon, a senior research fellow with the security technology developer Symantec.\r\nAs industry and government seek to repel the attacks for which the Internet is a launching pad, much of the effort involves understanding those who unleash malicious code and jiggle digital doorknobs. In the world that emerged after the Sept. 11 attacks, after all, understanding an elusive enemy has become a growing part of confronting a threat.\r\nSecurity experts have warned for several years that cyberterrorism presents a great potential threat to the United States, with its increasing dependence on computer networks for everything from weapons systems to hydroelectric dams, not to mention the underpinnings of commerce. Richard A. Clarke, a former White House adviser on terrorism, warned even before Sept. 11 of a coming "digital Pearl Harbor."\r\nAnd new vulnerabilities that could leave the way open to such an attack are being discovered all the time: according to Symantec, the number of software holes reported in the nation''s computer networks grew by 80 percent in 2002.\r\nStill, the company says it has yet to record a single cyberterrorist attack -- by its definition, one originating in a country on the State Department''s terror watch list. That could be because those inclined to commit terrorist acts do not yet have the know-how to do significant damage, or perhaps because hackers and adept virus writers are not motivated to disrupt networks for a cause. But should the two groups find common ground, the result could be devastating, said Michael A. Vatis, head of the Institute for Security Technology Studies at Dartmouth College.\r\n"There is still a big gap in our actual knowledge of our actual vulnerabilities to a serious attack," he said.\r\nThe government is working to close that gap. In the executive branch, cyberdefense is one of the concerns of the new Department of Homeland Security. Within the military, a task force with a $26 million annual budget is studying cyberwarfare for both its defensive and offensive potential, and President Bush has signed a directive, disclosed in February, calling for the military to develop policies to govern the waging of digital war. Regular exercises at the military service academies, most recently last week, prepare students to defend military networks against hackers.\r\nFor now, though, the quarry in such exercises remains elusive. The most damaging attacks and intrusions, experts say, are typically carried out by disgruntled corporate insiders intent on embezzlement or sabotage, or by individuals -- typically young and male -- seeking thrills and notoriety.\r\nThere was, to be sure, the explicitly political Code Red, a self-reproducing program known as a worm that was unleashed in 2001 to take control of thousands of computers and force them to block access to the White House Web site by flooding government servers with data. Many security experts believe that the program was developed in China in retaliation for the loss of a Chinese jet and its pilot after a collision with an American spy plane. Once the worm was detected, a tweak to the numeric online address for the White House Web site prevented disruption.\r\nCode Red drew attention to cyberattacks as a vehicle for political activism, said Roger Thompson, the director of malicious code research at TruSecure, a computer security company. "Instead of doing it to be jerks and show off to their buddies, they''re doing it to make a statement," he said.\r\nBut exploits coinciding with the war in Iraq were tame at best. Days before the United States began its air attacks, for example, an American military computer was hacked through a security hole in Microsoft software, according to Russ Cooper, a security expert with TruSecure, but no apparent damage was done. And though a programmer identifying himself as a Malaysian Muslim and calling himself Melhacker warned late last year that he would release a potent new virus on the Internet if the United States invaded Iraq, there has been no sign of it.\r\n"Individuals like Melhacker are considered more smoke than fire," said Ken Dunham, a senior intelligence analyst for iDefense, a computer security company. He said that developing profiles of such "malicious actors" -- both general and individual -- was helpful in defending against their activities and sometimes even curbing them. In Melhacker''s case, he said, the company gained the virus writer''s trust and obtained some of his code and tools last fall.\r\nThe threats and attacks witnessed recently are the sort of harassment that security experts dismiss as "weapons of mass annoyance." Experts who study the lives and motivations of virus writers and hackers -- and those who have wandered onto the wrong side of the law themselves -- say that while some want to push a political view, many are interested in making a splash rather than a statement.\r\n"Many of them probably think, ''Hey, hacking the Iraqi government would make me famous!"'' said Seth Pack, a former virus writer who lives in Spartanburg, S.C., and works in the computer security field. Similarly, current viruses are likely to be carried in e-mail with subject lines related to Iraq or the SARS epidemic because they are topical, and virus writers, like all marketers, look for the largest possible audience.\r\nAlthough some Web sites are chosen as hackers'' targets for their political significance -- an Iraqi government site was defaced during the war with the message, "Hacked, tracked, and now owned by the U.S.A." -- most such vandalism is carried out by hackers using automated programs that simply search for any vulnerable machine, said Vincent Weafer, the senior director of a Symantec security response unit.\r\nAside from the increase in Web site defacement, he said, the level of virus writing and hacking has not risen sharply in recent weeks. "What we were seeing a month ago is what we''re seeing today, and what we''ll probably see next month," he said.\r\nBusinesses and individuals who take security seriously can protect themselves fairly well against the threat of viruses and hacking, said James Lewis, head of the technology program for the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "It''s going to be irritating," he said, "but it''s not going to be the end of the world."\r\nAt the same time, the government is taking a less urgent view -- at least in what little it says on the subject -- than the specter of a "digital Pearl Harbor" might have indicated. The role of cybersecurity adviser has been moved out of the White House and into the new Department of Homeland Security, and Mr. Clarke''s successor in that role, Howard Schmidt, announced his resignation on Monday. "Nobody is in charge of the issue," Harris N.Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, complained after Mr. Schmidt''s resignation was announced. "Cybersecurity is unique, and does require somebody in charge."\r\nA spokesman for the Homeland Security Department said the administration took cybersecurity seriously, but as part of the overall security puzzle. "Our approach to cyber is it is combined with the other critical infrastructures; it''s not a stand-alone," said the spokesman, David Wray. Much of the work in understanding the threat and countering it is being carried out in private industry, think tanks and academia, he said, and the role of government is to "look at the body of work and at the body of evidence and find the ways to make the best use of it."\r\nThat puts the primary burden on researchers like Ms. Gordon, the security expert with Symantec, who has interviewed hundreds of digital mischief-makers. Experts note significant differences between those who unleash viruses, with potentially widespread but somewhat random effects, and hackers, whose targets are generally specific if arbitrary.\r\nMany of the early virus writers were computer researchers testing the limits of machines in the days before the Internet allowed rogue programs to spread around the world in minutes. But as the information on virus coding moved from the elite to the merely adept, there emerged a generation of "script kiddies" who could cobble together malicious programs from online tips.\r\nMs. Gordon said she had interviewed virus writers as young as 10 and as old as 50. For a young person starting out, she said, "it''s a real challenge to write a program that will recreate itself."\r\nBecause the writers tend to be young, they lose interest in the activity at about the time they might be prosecuted as adults for their mischief, Ms. Gordon said. Those who write viruses, and those who continue to do so into adulthood, tend to hold an immature point of view, she said. "They don''t realize the impact -- they don''t realize there are real people at the other end of the computers," she said. "They don''t tend to recognize the consequences of their actions."\r\nComputer intruders, on the other hand, tend to characterize themselves as explorers. "''Why hack?'' That''s like ''Why eat?"'' said Rafael Nunez, an Internet security consultant in Venezuela who has crossed over from the dark side of computer intrusion, in an e-mail message responding to questions. He now tests companies'' security by trying to defeat their network defenses. The allure of hacking, he said, is "the attraction of the unknown, to penetrate, to find out secret things."\r\nHackers and virus writers can work together, but many have a competitive and acrimonious relationship. "Virus coders are evil," Mr. Nunez said. "They want to cause destruction."\r\nA recent virus detected by Sophos, a security firm, seems to embody the tension between hackers and virus coders: the virus, which originated in India, contains text with insults directed at Pakistani hackers. The conflict "took it away from the geopolitical stage and put it into a geek-to-geek stage," said Chris Wraight, a technology consultant with Sophos.\r\nSome of those who pursue the craft say they are blending computer science and art. A Spanish programmer who goes by the online name Jtag said in an e-mail exchange that he found in viruses "some kind of ''artistic'' beauty."\r\n"It''s like to give ''life'' to one creation and this ''life-form'' takes control of things, replicating, transforming and giving his own ''touch'' to another programs (infecting them)," he wrote.\r\nMr. Wraight of Sophos said a more apt comparison is to a sprayer of graffiti. Virus writers have the potential to spread a message to millions of computers. He expects the trend toward political hacking to continue. "The whole notion of trying to use the world stage for political views is going to grow over time," he said.\r\nAnd the attacks will grow more potent, said Mr. Vatis, who served as the first director of the National Infrastructure Protection Center within the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Referring to the work of the military cyberwar force, he said, "The fact that our own government has offensive information programs that it won''t talk about except to acknowledge that they exist -- that should tell us something." \r\n\r\nOn Guard\r\nStudent Teams Plot Digital Defense Strategy\r\nINSTRUCTORS at the nation''s military service academies now teach cyberdefense as a part of the computer science curriculum. "It''s part of their skill set," said Maj. Scott Lathrop, information warfare instructor at the United States Military Academy. "We think it''s important because the Army is becoming so digitized."\r\nThe students will use the skills they acquire wherever they end up in the armed services, he said. About 75 percent of the class is devoted to cyberdefense, and 25 percent to understanding and carrying out cyberattacks -- but with the general goal of girding defensive skills, he said.\r\nWest Point and the National Security Agency have organized an annual challenge in which teams of 13 to 30 computer science students from each of the five service academies compete to repel cyberattacks.\r\nThe third such exercise, held last week and described online at www.itoc.usma.edu/cdx/, involved establishing a computer network for a multinational force in "a liberation operation against the hostile country of Red" and defending it against Red cyberattack forces, a role that is played by the National Security Agency. The teams were evaluated on their ability to remain online and to recover from or prevent security breaches. The security agency is to announce the winner next week.\r\n', '');

The images made the messages much bulkier than simple text messages, so the spammers were using more bandwidth to churn out fewer spams. But they also knew that, to filters scanning for telltale spam words in the text of e-mail messages, a picture of the words ''''Hot Stox!!'''' is significantly different from the words themselves.\r\nSo the bulk e-mailers behind this campaign seemed to calculate that they had a good chance of slipping their stock pitches past spam defenses to land in the in-boxes of prospective customers.\r\nIt worked, but only briefly. Antispam developers at MessageLabs, one of several companies that essentially reroute their clients'' e-mail traffic through proprietary spam-scrubbing servers before delivering it, quickly developed a ''''checksum,'''' or fingerprint, for the images, and created a filter to block them.\r\nAdvances in spam-catching techniques mean that most computer users no longer face the paralyzing crush of junk messages that began threatening the very utility of e-mail communications just a few years ago.\r\nBut spammers have hardly given up, and as they improve and adapt their techniques, network managers must still face down the pill-pushers, get-rich-quick artists and others who use billions of unwanted e-mail messages to troll for income. ''''For the end user, spam isn''t that much of a problem anymore,'''' said Matt Sergeant, MessageLabs'' senior antispam technologist. ''''But for the network, and for people like us, it definitely is.''''\r\nShortly after MessageLabs created a filter to catch the stock spams, the images they contained changed again.\r\nThey were now arriving with what looked to the naked eye like a gray border. Zooming in, however, the MessageLabs team discovered that the border was made up of thousands of randomly ordered dots. Indeed, every message in that particular spam campaign was generated with a new image of the border -- each with its own random array of dots.\r\n''''That was kind of cool and kind of funny,'''' said Mr. Sergeant, a soft-spoken British transplant who spends his days helping to douse spam fires from his home office outside Toronto.\r\nDuring a recent meeting at the company''s New York office, in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Sergeant and a colleague, Nick Johnson, an antispam developer visiting from MessageLabs'' headquarters in Gloucester, England, expressed both amusement and respect over the sheer creativity of the world''s most prolific spammers, who continue to dump hundreds of millions of junk messages into the e-mail stream each day.\r\n''''It was almost like they knew what we were doing,'''' Mr. Sergeant said.\r\nSEVERAL surveys -- from AOL, the Pew Internet and American Life Project and others -- have indicated that the amount of spam reaching consumer inboxes has at least stabilized.\r\nThat is true for users whose networks are protected by off-site, third-party filtering services like MessageLabs'', as well as those protected by network software or in-house equipment that filters messages before they hit a company''s e-mail server.\r\nIf individual users also have personal spam filters installed on their computers, their in-box spam count can be reduced to a trickle.\r\nBut spam continues to account for roughly 70 percent of all e-mail messages on the Internet, despite tough antispam laws across the globe (including the Can-Spam Act in the United States), despite vigorous lawsuits against individual junk-mail senders and despite the famous prediction, by Bill Gates at the World Economic Forum in 2004, that spam would be eradicated by 2006.\r\nThe continuing defiance of spammers was demonstrated last week when one of them forced Blue Security, an antispam company based in Israel, to shut down its services. The company gave customers the power to enact mob justice on spammers by overloading them with requests to be removed from mailing lists. A spammer in Russia retaliated by knocking out Blue Security''s Web site and threatening virus attacks against its customers. Blue Security said it would back off rather than be responsible for a ''''cyberwar.''''\r\nWhile there are some indications that the growth rate of spam has plateaued or even slowed, experts say that spikes are always looming. That is partly because spammers can hide themselves or their operations in countries where law enforcement is lax, from Russia and Eastern Europe to China and Nigeria. Because some spammers can churn out 200 million or more messages a day, and because less than 1 percent of those need to bring responses from naive, click-happy users to turn handsome profits, there is little incentive to stop.\r\n''''That''s really just the daily battle,'''' said Mr. Sergeant, who routinely shares intelligence on individual spammers with other antispam organizations and with the F.B.I. and other law enforcement agencies. ''''That 1 percent is the wall, really -- it''s the spammers creating something new that we just haven''t seen before. And for us it''s a matter of how quickly we can deal with it.''''\r\nThere is plenty to deal with. Most spam is still just, well, spam: low-rent pitches for stocks and penis-enlargement pills. But there are also the more immediate menaces, including attempts to trick consumers into giving up bank and credit card information -- or the use of spam to deliver viruses and other malicious software.\r\nFrom an industry perspective, antivirus and antispam scanning are virtually inseparable, and MessageLabs is among many companies jockeying to position themselves as full-service contractors, offering to filter, scan, scrub and archive both incoming and outgoing mail.\r\nIt''s a lucrative strategy.\r\nIDC, the research firm, estimates that the global market for ''''messaging security'''' will grow to $2.6 billion by 2009, from $675 million in 2004. The category consists mostly of antispam services, but also covers outbound filtering -- something that employers now demand and all vendors include, according to Brian Burke, an IDC analyst.\r\nIDC estimates that the larger market for ''''secure content management,'''' which folds in virus protection, Web filtering and spyware protection, will grow to $11.4 billion by 2009 from $4.8 billion in 2004.\r\nIn 2005, about 60 percent of businesses were using software to combat spam, with the rest split between using managed services and antispam hardware, according to Osterman Research, which conducts market analysis on the messaging industry. But the percentage of businesses moving to managed services is expected to double, to almost 40 percent, during the next two years.\r\nIn that context, it may not be surprising that Microsoft recently acquired FrontBridge, the third-largest provider of managed e-mail services. MessageLabs and Postini, based in San Carlos, Calif., have long been the leaders in the category.\r\nWhile much growth in this field will be driven by the threat of viruses and other bugs attached to messages, the wave of simple but inventive marketing spam remains a big concern -- and, in many ways, is the harder thing to catch. Consider the stock spam using random dots in the borders.\r\n''''We actually developed some technology to detect borders in images and figure out the entropy -- that is, to figure out if the border was random,'''' Mr. Sergeant said. ''''So that was fine.'''' Of course, shortly afterward, ''''they decided to stop using the borders,'''' he added.\r\nFrom there, the senders began placing a small number of barely perceptible and, again, randomly placed dots -- a pink one here, a blue one there, a green one near the bottom -- throughout the images. Then they shifted to multiple images, with words spelled partially in plain text and partially as images, so that the content, when viewed on a common e-mail reader like Outlook or AOL, would look like an ordinary message.\r\n''''There are loads of different kinds of obfuscation,'''' Mr. Johnson said. ''''They''ve realized that people are looking for V1agra spelled with a ''1'' and st0ck with a ''zero'' and that sort of thing, so they might try some sort of meaning obfuscation, like just referring to a watch as a ''wrist accessory'' or something like that. So they say something like, ''Drape your wrist with this elegant accessory.''\r\n''''Any way not to say ''Rolex,'' '''' he added, ''''so it''s quite cryptic.''''\r\nSitting in a windowless conference room, Mr. Sergeant alternated his gaze between the conversation at hand and the streams of filtered e-mail subject lines slithering down his laptop screen.\r\nThe lines were feedback from the company''s ''''radar'''' system, which allows team members to test a new ''''rule'''' or ''''signature'''' that they have devised on a slice of the incoming torrent of spam. If the rule is too broad and general, legitimate e-mail messages -- dreaded ''''false positives'''' in the parlance of spam assassins -- will begin showing up on the radar.\r\nMr. Johnson plugs into the radar himself and highlights a common obfuscation technique he calls ''''gappy text'''': words with spaces between the letters, to fool filters designed to look only for whole words. The example was in a message advertising a work-at-home opportunity out of ''''T u l s a , O k l a h o m a .''''\r\n''''That''s something that we might consider signaturing, that whole line there, with the spaces,'''' he said, ''''because it''s not very common behavior for someone to want to write like that.''''\r\nMr. Johnson began reading from a customer testimonial included in the same message: ''''I was skeptical at first. I made money. I couldn''t believe it!''''\r\nMr. Sergeant erupted in laughter.\r\n''''It''s a classic joke in our office,'''' Mr. Johnson said. ''''If it''s advertised in spam, it must be true.''''\r\nMR. JOHNSON described another trick that a spammer had recently deployed so that messages peddling Viagra would move into recipients'' in-boxes.\r\nBy default, most modern e-mail software can display messages that are written with the same text formatting code used to create Web pages -- known as hypertext markup language, or HTML. Like viewers of Web pages, e-mail users never actually see the underlying code, or ''''tags'''' used to make some words appear, say, bold or italicized. But spam filters scan this code, too, looking for ''''spammy behavior,'''' as Mr. Johnson put it.\r\nIn this instance, a clever spam writer slipped a Viagra message past many filters by spelling the word with several I''s, then using HTML code to shove all of the I''s together. ''''Whenever you view this in your e-mail program,'''' Mr. Johnson said, ''''the letter spacing is set to minus-3 pixels, so it will show all these I''s on top of each other, and it will look like one I.\r\n''''That was quite an impressive one, actually,'''' he said.\r\nAnd vexing, Mr. Sergeant added. Without a special rule created by the team, it would have been virtually impossible for a machine to examine the source code of a message and determine that this was the word ''''Viagra.''''\r\n''''The word appears on screen as it should,'''' Mr. Sergeant said. ''''But if you actually are examining the HTML, you just couldn''t pull out a word from it. So while a computer can''t figure out what the words are in the e-mail, the human eyes can.''''\r\nA company like MessageLabs tries to avoid examining messages at this level. Instead, it prefers to stop much of the junk at the door, using what is called I.P. blocking. This prevents the receipt of messages from a particular Internet protocol address already identified as a spamming source.\r\nThis technique is sometimes frowned upon by Internet purists, because it can punish innocent users by blacklisting a whole range of addresses from a single host. But Mr. Sergeant said that I.P. blocking had become more refined since the early days of spam fighting. ''''It''s very, very important to us,'''' he said. ''''It''s our first line of defense, really.''''\r\nStill, spammers can often get around this by turning to zombie bots. These are vast networks of personal computers that have been surreptitiously infected with malicious software, permitting a spammer to use their computing power, without the owners'' knowledge, to spew or relay spam, viruses, keyloggers, phony ''''update your bank account'''' messages and other dark payloads.\r\nZombies now deliver half to three-quarters of all spam, according to a Federal Trade Commission report to Congress in December on the state of the spam problem. Among the zombies'' many advantages is an ever-shifting collection of I.P. addresses.\r\nAnother trump card was handed to spammers just over a year and a half ago, when VeriSign, the security and services company that controls the dot-com and dot-net network domains, unveiled a quicker way to update domain names.\r\nAlthough a boon to people setting up their own sites, the new system decreased the time needed for a newly registered domain name to be activated, to 5 minutes from about 12 hours. That put spammers, armed with stolen credit cards and a willingness to buy and quickly abandon domain names, at a new advantage.\r\nVeriSign updates its domain information every 12 hours. ''''But a spammer can register a new domain and have it live within 5 minutes,'''' Mr. Sergeant said. ''''So he''s got a big window where nobody has any information about his domain. They make use of that window.''''\r\nMESSAGELABS'' filtering database tries to discover new zombie bots by studying the behavior of e-mail messages from new addresses. Normally, for instance, a machine looking to deliver a message to another machine essentially says ''''hello'''' by passing an identifying string of code. Most legitimate mail servers will say ''''hello'''' with the same string over and over, for every message.\r\n''''When a machine communicates with us in two, three, four different ways within a small time frame,'''' Mr. Sergeant said, ''''that makes the sending machine look kind of weird.'''' That behavior can indicate ''''it''s not a real machine, it''s just one of these drone armies.''''\r\nSome low-end spamming software, too, may leave characteristic fingerprints -- for instance, the telltale way in which it forges the header information -- that spam fighters gradually add to their cumulative antispam wisdom.\r\nFor all the algorithmic derring-do, however, sooner or later the game turns not on I.P. addresses or software fingerprints, but on the content of the message. It''s the approach that MessageLabs researchers like least, but one that spammers constantly force on them.\r\nNigerian e-mail scams are a particular nuisance in this regard. Familiar to any e-mail user, these are the ones seeking an advance payment from the recipient to help rescue a deposed prince or to collect a percentage on some elaborately portrayed fortune. They are difficult to weed out because the senders often use Web-based e-mail services like Yahoo or Gmail, so I.P. blocking is impractical.\r\nThe language used in the e-mail messages, too, is often common enough that no particular string lends itself to safe rule-making; the risk of filtering out legitimate communications would be high.\r\nMessageLabs has spent a year compiling a database, ''''Scam DNA,'''' of 15,000 Nigerian scam messages, and used pattern analysis to build a family tree of the scams. It has found that most of the pitches are derived among a few hundred templates.\r\n''''Scam DNA basically codifies this into an algorithm,'''' Mr. Sergeant said, ''''where, hopefully, we can detect this going on and find new scams based on the old scams.''''\r\nBut even if it works, the amount of spam it would eliminate from the overall deluge would be negligible by almost any measure, and Mr. Sergeant and his team will still be forced into encounters with ''''C i a l i s'''' and ''''st0x'''' and ''''Viiiiagra.'''' The researchers are certain that the last, with multiple I''s shoved together, is the handiwork of Leo Kuvayev.\r\nMr. Kuvayev is No. 3 on the list of the world''s most prolific and notorious spammers, maintained atSpamhaus.org, a London-based watchdog group. The listing is not undeserved.\r\nIn Massachusetts last October, a Suffolk Superior Court judge, D. Lloyd MacDonald, levied $37 million in penalties on Mr. Kuvayev and six other people after deciding against them -- in absentia -- in a lawsuit brought by the state''s attorney general, Tom Reilly.\r\nThe suit contended that the defendants, who once worked out of Newton, Mass., and Boston, used ''''a complicated web of Internet sites and domain names selling a variety of illegal products,'''' including counterfeit drugs, pirated software, pornography and phony designer watches.\r\nSpam watchers say they believe Mr. Kuvayev is now in Russia -- still very much in business and employing a team of spam writers to continue poking holes in the world''s filters.\r\n''''They must be pretty good HTML gurus,'''' Mr. Sergeant said, ''''who must really know their stuff.''''\r\nMr. Sergeant said that just two men -- Mr. Kuvayev and Alex Blood, a Ukrainian who is rated the No. 1 junk mailer by Spamhaus -- hammer the world''s e-mail systems with five million messages an hour. ''''You''re talking about being responsible for something like 10 percent of all e-mail on the Internet,'''' Mr. Sergeant said, ''''from just two guys.''''\r\nTwo guys who, along with plenty of others, may keep antispam outfits like MessageLabs in business.\r\n''''A lot of people would say, ''Why would you want to have these spammers prosecuted and why give information to the F.B.I., because surely you want there to be more spam?'' '''' Mr. Sergeant said. ''''But with the volumes these guys are sending, it would actually help us more if there were less of it.\r\n''''We''re just not going to kid ourselves and say we believe that spam is ever going to go away,'''' he added. ''''It''s always going to be a prob-lem.''''\r\n', '');
INSERT INTO `articles` VALUES(48, 'Russia and Georgia Clash Over Breakaway Region', '2008-08-09', 'nyt', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/09/world/europe/09georgia.html', 'GORI, Georgia -- Russia conducted airstrikes on Georgian targets on Friday evening, escalating the conflict in a separatist area of Georgia that is shaping into a test of the power and military reach of an emboldened Kremlin. Earlier in the day, Russian troops and armored vehicles had rolled into South Ossetia, supporting the breakaway region in its bitter conflict with Georgia.\r\nThe United States and other Western nations, joined by NATO, condemned the violence and demanded a cease-fire. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice went a step further, calling on Russia to withdraw its forces. But the Russian soldiers remained, and Georgian officials reported at least one airstrike, on the Black Sea port of Poti, late on Friday night.\r\nRussian military units -- including tank, artillery and reconnaissance -- arrived in Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia, on Saturday to help Russian peacekeepers there, in response to overnight shelling by Georgian forces, state television in Russia reported, citing the Ministry of Defense. Ground assault aircraft were also mobilized, the Ministry said.\r\nAlso on Saturday a senior Georgian official said by telephone that Russian bombers were flying over Georgia and that the presidential offices and residence in Tbilisi had been evacuated. The official added that Georgian forces still had control of Tskhinvali.\r\nNeither side showed any indication of backing down. Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia declared that ''''war has started,'''' and President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia accused Russia of a ''''well-planned invasion'''' and mobilized Georgia''s military reserves. There were signs as well of a cyberwarfare campaign, as Georgian government Web sites were crashing intermittently during the day.\r\nThe escalation risked igniting a renewed and sustained conflict in the Caucasus region, an important conduit for the flow of oil from the Caspian Sea to world markets and an area where conflict has flared for years along Russia''s borders, most recently in Chechnya.\r\nThe military incursion into Georgia marked a fresh sign of Kremlin confidence and resolve, and also provided a test of the capacities of the Russian military, which Mr. Putin had tried to modernize and re-equip during his two presidential terms.\r\nFrictions between Georgia and South Ossetia, which has declared de facto independence, have simmered for years, but intensified when Mr. Saakashvili came to power in Georgia and made national unification a centerpiece of his agenda. Mr. Saakashvili, a close American ally who has sought NATO membership for Georgia, is loathed at the Kremlin in part because he had positioned himself as a spokesman for democracy movements and alignment with the West.\r\nEarlier this year Russia announced that it was expanding support for the separatist regions. Georgia labeled the new support an act of annexation.\r\nThe conflict in Georgia also appeared to suggest the limits of the power of President Dmitri A. Medvedev, Mr. Putin''s hand-picked successor. During the day, it was Mr. Putin''s stern statements from China, where he was visiting the opening of the Olympic Games, that appeared to define Russia''s position.\r\nBut Mr. Medvedev made a public statement as well, making it unclear who was directing Russia''s military operations. Officially, that authority rests with Mr. Medvedev, and foreign policy is outside Mr. Putin''s portfolio.\r\n''''The war in Ossetia instantly showed the idiocy of our state management,'''' said a commentator on the liberal radio station, Ekho Moskvy. ''''Who is in charge -- Putin or Medvedev?''''\r\nThe war between Georgia and South Ossetia, until recently labeled a ''''frozen conflict,'''' stretches back to the early 1990s, when South Ossetia and another separatist region, Abkhazia, gained de facto independence from Georgia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The region settled into a tenuous peace monitored by Russian peacekeepers, but frictions with Georgia increased sharply in 2004, when Mr. Saakashvili was elected.\r\nReports conflicted throughout Friday about whether Georgian or Russian forces had won control of Tskhinvali, the capital of the mountainous rebel province. It was unclear late on Friday whether ground combat had taken place between Russian and Georgian soldiers, or had been limited to fighting between separatists and Georgian forces.\r\nMarat Kulakhmetov, commander of Russian peacekeeping forces in Tskhinvali, said early on Saturday that South Ossetian separatists still held most of the city and that Georgian forces were only present on its southern edge.\r\nThat report aligned with a statement by Georgia''s ambassador to the United Nations, Irakli Alasania, who said that Georgian military units held eight villages at the capital''s edge. Georgian officials asserted that Russian warplanes had attacked Georgian forces and civilians in Tskhinvali, and that airports in four Georgian cities had been hit.\r\nShota Utiashvili, an official at the Georgian Interior Ministry, said they included the Vaziany military base outside of Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, a military base in Marneuli, and airports in the cities of Delisi and Kutaisi.\r\n''''We are under massive attack,'''' he said.\r\nLate in the night, George Arveladze, an adviser to Mr. Saakashvili, said that Russian planes had bombed the commercial seaport of Poti, where one worker was missing and several others were wounded. Poti is an export point for oil from the Caspian Sea; Mr. Arveladze said the initial reports indicated that the oil terminal had not been struck.\r\nEduard Kokoity, the president of South Ossetia, said in a statement on a government Web site that hundreds of civilians had been killed in fighting in the capital. Russian peacekeepers stationed in South Ossetia said that 12 peacekeeping soldiers were killed Friday and that 50 were wounded. The claims of casualties by all sides could not be independently verified.\r\nAnalysts said that either Georgia or Russia could be trying to seize an opportune moment -- with world leaders focused on the start of the 2008 Olympics this week -- to reclaim the territory, and to settle the dispute before a new American presidential administration comes to office.\r\nRichard C. Holbrooke, the former American ambassador to the United Nations, said that Russia''s aims were clear. ''''They have two goals,'''' he said. ''''To do a creeping annexation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and, secondly, to overthrow Saakashvili, who is a tremendous thorn in their side.''''\r\nA spokesman for Mr. Medvedev declined to comment.\r\nThe United States State Department issued a press release late Friday saying that John D. Negroponte, the deputy secretary of state, had summoned the Russian charge d''affairs to press for a de-escalation of force. ''''We deplore today''s Russian attacks by strategic bombers and missiles, which are threatening civilian lives,'''' the statement said.\r\nThe United States also said Friday that it would send an envoy to the region to try to broker an end to the fighting.\r\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany issued a statement calling on both sides ''''to halt the use of force immediately.'''' Germany has taken a leading role in trying to ease the tensions over Abkhazia.\r\nThe trigger for the fresh escalation began last weekend, when South Ossetia accused Georgia of firing mortars into the enclave after six Georgian policemen were killed in the border area by a roadside bomb. As tensions grew, South Ossetia began sending women and children out of the enclave. The refugee crisis intensified Friday as relief groups said thousands of refugees, mostly women and children, were streaming across the border into the North Caucasus city of Vladikavkaz in Russia.\r\nEarly on Friday, Russia''s Channel One television showed Russian tanks entering South Ossetia and reported that two battalions reinforced by tanks and armored personnel carriers were approaching its capital.\r\nThere were unconfirmed reports that Georgian forces had shot down two Russian planes and that its aircraft had bombed a convoy of Russian tanks. Russian state television showed what it said was a destroyed Georgian tank in Tskhinvali, its turret smoldering.\r\nWomen and children in Tskhinvali were hiding in basements while men had fled to the woods, said a woman reached by telephone in the neighboring Russian region of North Ossetia, who said she had been in phone contact with relatives there. She declined to give her name.\r\nIn Gori, a city outside South Ossetia and about 12 miles from Tskhinvali, residents said there had been sporadic bombing all day. The city was shaken by numerous vibrations from the impact of bombs on Friday evening. One Russian bomb exploded in Gori near a textile factory and a cellphone tower, leaving a crater.\r\nAt the United Nations on Friday, diplomats continued to wrangle over the text of a statement after attempts to agree to compromise language collapsed Friday afternoon, after nearly three hours of consultations.\r\nThe Russians, who had called the emergency session, proposed a short, three-paragraph statement that expressed concern about the escalating violence, and singled out Georgia and South Ossetia as needing to cease hostilities and return to the negotiating table.\r\nBut one phrase calling on all parties to ''''renounce the use of force'''' met with opposition, particularly from the United States, France and Britain. The three countries argued that the statement was unbalanced, one European diplomat said, because that language would have undermined Georgia''s ability to defend itself. Belgium, which holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council this month, circulated a revised draft calling for an immediate cessation of hostility and for ''''all parties'''' to return to the negotiating table. By dropping the specific reference to Georgia and South Ossetia, the compromise statement would also encompass Russia.\r\nThe Security Council was scheduled to meet Saturday to resume deliberations. China, in its statement during the early morning debate, had asked for a traditional cease-fire out of respect for the opening of the Olympics.\r\nThere are over 2,000 American citizens in Georgia, Pentagon officials said. Among them are about 130 trainers -- mostly American military personnel but with about 30 Defense Department civilians --assisting the Georgian military with preparations for deployments to Iraq.\r\nThe American military was taking no actions regarding the outbreak of violence, according to Pentagon and military officials. While there has been some contact with the Georgian authorities, the Defense Department had received no requests for assistance, the officials said.\r\n', '');
INSERT INTO `articles` VALUES(49, 'Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks', '2008-08-13', 'nyt', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html', 'Weeks before bombs started falling on Georgia, a security researcher in suburban Massachusetts was watching an attack against the country in cyberspace.\r\nJose Nazario of Arbor Networks in Lexington noticed a stream of data directed at Georgian government sites containing the message: ''''win+love+in+Rusia.''''\r\nOther Internet experts in the United States said the attacks against Georgia''s Internet infrastructure began as early as July 20, with coordinated barrages of millions of requests -- known as distributed denial of service, or D.D.O.S., attacks -- that overloaded and effectively shut down Georgian servers.\r\nResearchers at Shadowserver, a volunteer group that tracks malicious network activity, reported that the Web site of the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, had been rendered inoperable for 24 hours by multiple D.D.O.S. attacks. They said the command and control server that directed the attack was based in the United States and had come online several weeks before it began the assault.\r\nAs it turns out, the July attack may have been a dress rehearsal for an all-out cyberwar once the shooting started between Georgia and Russia. According to Internet technical experts, it was the first time a known cyberattack had coincided with a shooting war.\r\nBut it will likely not be the last, said Bill Woodcock, the research director of the Packet Clearing House, a nonprofit organization that tracks Internet traffic. He said cyberattacks are so inexpensive and easy to mount, with few fingerprints, they will almost certainly remain a feature of modern warfare.\r\n''''It costs about 4 cents per machine,'''' Mr. Woodcock said. ''''You could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread, so you would be foolish not to.''''\r\nExactly who was behind the cyberattack is not known. The Georgian government blamed Russia for the attacks, but the Russian government said it was not involved. In the end, Georgia, with a population of just 4.6 million and a relative latecomer to the Internet, saw little effect beyond inaccessibility to many of its government Web sites, which limited the government''s ability to spread its message online and to connect with sympathizers around the world during the fighting with Russia.\r\nIt ranks 74th out of 234 nations in terms of Internet addresses, behind Nigeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia and El Salvador. Cyberattacks have far less impact on such a country than they might on a more Internet-dependent nation, like Israel, Estonia or the United States, where vital services like transportation, power and banking are tied to the Internet.\r\nIn Georgia, media, communications and transportation companies were also attacked, according to security researchers. Shadowserver saw the attack against Georgia spread to computers throughout the government after Russian troops entered the Georgian province of South Ossetia. The National Bank of Georgia''s Web site was defaced at one point. Images of 20th-century dictators as well as an image of Georgia''s president, Mr. Saakashvili, were placed on the site. ''''Could this somehow be indirect Russian action? Yes, but considering Russia is past playing nice and uses real bombs, they could have attacked more strategic targets or eliminated the infrastructure kinetically,'''' said Gadi Evron, an Israeli network security expert. ''''The nature of what''s going on isn''t clear,'''' he said.\r\nThe phrase ''''a wilderness of mirrors'''' usually describes the murky world surrounding opposing intelligence agencies. It also neatly summarizes the array of conflicting facts and accusations encompassing the cyberwar now taking place in tandem with the Russian fighting in Georgia.\r\nIn addition to D.D.O.S. attacks that crippled Georgia''s limited Internet infrastructure, researchers said there was evidence of redirection of Internet traffic through Russian telecommunications firms beginning last weekend. The attacks continued on Tuesday, controlled by software programs that were located in hosting centers controlled by a Russian telecommunications firms. A Russian-language Web site, stopgeorgia.ru, also continued to operate and offer software for download used for D.D.O.S. attacks.\r\nOver the weekend a number of American computer security researchers tracking malicious programs known as botnets, which were blasting streams of useless data at Georgian computers, said they saw clear evidence of a shadowy St. Petersburg-based criminal gang known as the Russian Business Network, or R.B.N.\r\n''''The attackers are using the same tools and the same attack commands that have been used by the R.B.N. and in some cases the attacks are being launched from computers they are known to control,'''' said Don Jackson, director of threat intelligence for SecureWorks, a computer security firm based in Atlanta.\r\nHe noted that in the run-up to the start of the war over the weekend, computer researchers had watched as botnets were ''''staged'''' in preparation for the attack, and then activated shortly before Russian air strikes began on Saturday.\r\nThe evidence on R.B.N. and whether it is controlled by, or coordinating with the Russian government remains unclear. The group has been linked to online criminal activities including child pornography, malware, identity theft, phishing and spam. Other computer researchers said that R.B.N.''s role is ambiguous at best. ''''We are simply seeing the attacks coming from known hosting services,'''' said Paul Ferguson, an advanced threat researcher at Trend Micro, an Internet security company based in Cupertino, Calif. A Russian government spokesman said that it was possible that individuals in Russia or elsewhere had taken it upon themselves to start the attacks.\r\n''''I cannot exclude this possibility,'''' Yevgeniy Khorishko, a spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Washington, said. ''''There are people who don''t agree with something and they try to express themselves. You have people like this in your country.''''\r\n''''Jumping to conclusions is premature,'''' said Mr. Evron, who founded the Israeli Computer Emergency Response Team.', '');

The goal is to simulate what it would take for adversaries to shut down the country''s power stations, telecommunications and aviation systems, or freeze the financial markets -- in an effort to build better defenses against such attacks, as well as a new generation of online weapons.\r\nJust as the invention of the atomic bomb changed warfare and deterrence 64 years ago, a new international race has begun to develop cyberweapons and systems to protect against them.\r\nThousands of daily attacks on federal and private computer systems in the United States -- many from China and Russia, some malicious and some testing chinks in the patchwork of American firewalls -- have prompted the Obama administration to review American strategy.\r\nPresident Obama is expected to propose a far larger defensive effort in coming days, including an expansion of the $17 billion, five-year program that Congress approved last year, the appointment of a White House official to coordinate the effort, and an end to a running bureaucratic battle over who is responsible for defending against cyberattacks.\r\nBut Mr. Obama is expected to say little or nothing about the nation''s offensive capabilities, on which the military and the nation''s intelligence agencies have been spending billions. In interviews over the past several months, a range of military and intelligence officials, as well as outside experts, have described a huge increase in the sophistication of American cyberwarfare capabilities.\r\nBecause so many aspects of the American effort to develop cyberweapons and define their proper use remain classified, many of those officials declined to speak on the record. The White House declined several requests for interviews or to say whether Mr. Obama as a matter of policy supports or opposes the use of American cyberweapons.\r\nThe most exotic innovations under consideration would enable a Pentagon programmer to surreptitiously enter a computer server in Russia or China, for example, and destroy a ''''botnet'''' -- a potentially destructive program that commandeers infected machines into a vast network that can be clandestinely controlled -- before it could be unleashed in the United States.\r\nOr American intelligence agencies could activate malicious code that is secretly embedded on computer chips when they are manufactured, enabling the United States to take command of an enemy''s computers by remote control over the Internet. That, of course, is exactly the kind of attack officials fear could be launched on American targets, often through Chinese-made chips or computer servers.\r\nSo far, however, there are no broad authorizations for American forces to engage in cyberwar. The invasion of the Qaeda computer in Iraq several years ago and the covert activity in Iran were each individually authorized by Mr. Bush. When he issued a set of classified presidential orders in January 2008 to organize and improve America''s online defenses, the administration could not agree on how to write the authorization.\r\nA principal architect of that order said the issue had been passed on to the next president, in part because of the complexities of cyberwar operations that, by necessity, would most likely be conducted on both domestic and foreign Internet sites. After the controversy surrounding domestic spying, Mr. Bush''s aides concluded, the Bush White House did not have the credibility or the political capital to deal with the subject.\r\nElectronic Vulnerabilities\r\nCyberwar would not be as lethal as atomic war, of course, nor as visibly dramatic. But when Mike McConnell, the former director of national intelligence, briefed Mr. Bush on the threat in May 2007, he argued that if a single large American bank were successfully attacked ''''it would have an order-of-magnitude greater impact on the global economy'''' than the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Mr. McConnell, who left office three months ago, warned last year that ''''the ability to threaten the U.S. money supply is the equivalent of today''s nuclear weapon.''''\r\nThe scenarios developed last year for the incoming president by Mr. McConnell and his coordinator for cybersecurity, Melissa Hathaway, went further. They described vulnerabilities including an attack on Wall Street and one intended to bring down the nation''s electric power grid. Most were extrapolations of attacks already tried.\r\nToday, Ms. Hathaway is the primary author of White House cyberstrategy and has been traveling the country talking in vague terms about recent, increasingly bold attacks on the computer networks that keep the country running. Government officials will not discuss the details of a recent attack on the air transportation network, other than to say the attack never directly affected air traffic control systems.\r\nStill, the specter of an attack that could blind air traffic controllers and, perhaps, the military''s aerospace defense networks haunts military and intelligence officials. (The saving grace of the air traffic control system, officials say, is that it is so old that it is not directly connected to the Internet.)\r\nStudies, with code names like Dark Angel, have focused on whether cellphone towers, emergency-service communications and hospital systems could be brought down, to sow chaos.\r\nBut the theoretical has, at times, become real.\r\n''''We have seen Chinese network operations inside certain of our electricity grids,'''' said Joel F. Brenner, who oversees counterintelligence operations for Dennis Blair, Mr. McConnell''s successor as national intelligence director, speaking at the University of Texas at Austin this month. ''''Do I worry about those grids, and about air traffic control systems, water supply systems, and so on? You bet I do.''''\r\nBut the broader question -- one the administration so far declines to discuss -- is whether the best defense against cyberattack is the development of a robust capability to wage cyberwar.\r\nAs Mr. Obama''s team quickly discovered, the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies both concluded in Mr. Bush''s last years in office that it would not be enough to simply build higher firewalls and better virus detectors or to restrict access to the federal government''s own computers.\r\n''''The fortress model simply will not work for cyber,'''' said one senior military officer who has been deeply engaged in the debate for several years. ''''Someone will always get in.''''\r\nThat thinking has led to a debate over whether lessons learned in the nuclear age -- from the days of ''''mutually assured destruction'''' -- apply to cyberwar.\r\nBut in cyberwar, it is hard to know where to strike back, or even who the attacker might be. Others have argued for borrowing a page from Mr. Bush''s pre-emption doctrine by going into foreign computers to destroy malicious software before it is unleashed into the world''s digital bloodstream. But that could amount to an act of war, and many argue it is a losing game, because the United States is more dependent on a constantly running Internet system than many of its potential adversaries, and therefore could suffer more damage in a counterattack.\r\nIn a report scheduled to be released Wednesday, the National Research Council will argue that although an offensive cybercapability is an important asset for the United States, the nation is lacking a clear strategy, and secrecy surrounding preparations has hindered national debate, according to several people familiar with the report.\r\nThe advent of Internet attacks -- especially those suspected of being directed by nations, not hackers -- has given rise to a new term inside the Pentagon and the National Security Agency: ''''hybrid warfare.''''\r\nIt describes a conflict in which attacks through the Internet can be launched as a warning shot -- or to pave the way for a traditional attack.\r\nEarly hints of this new kind of warfare emerged in the confrontation between Russia and Estonia in April 2007. Clandestine groups -- it was never determined if they had links to the Russian government -- commandeered computers around the globe and directed a fire hose of data at Estonia''s banking system and its government Web sites.\r\nThe computer screens of Estonians trying to do business with the government online were frozen, if they got anything at all. It was annoying, but by the standards of cyberwar, it was child''s play.\r\nIn August 2008, when Russia invaded Georgia, the cyberattacks grew more widespread. Georgians were denied online access to news, cash and air tickets. The Georgian government had to move its Internet activity to servers in Ukraine when its own servers locked up, but the attacks did no permanent damage.\r\nEvery few months, it seems, some agency, research group or military contractor runs a war game to assess the United States'' vulnerability. Senior intelligence officials were shocked to discover how easy it was to permanently disable a large power generator. That prompted further studies to determine if attackers could take down a series of generators, bringing whole parts of the country to a halt.\r\nAnother war game that the Department of Homeland Security sponsored in March 2008, called Cyber Storm II, envisioned a far larger, coordinated attack against the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It studied a disruption of chemical plants, rail lines, oil and gas pipelines and private computer networks. That study and others like it concluded that when attacks go global, the potential economic repercussions increase exponentially.\r\nTo prove the point, Mr. McConnell, then the director of national intelligence, spent much of last summer urging senior government officials to examine the Treasury Department''s scramble to contain the effects of the collapse of Bear Stearns. Markets froze, he said, because ''''what backs up that money is confidence -- an accounting system that is reconcilable.'''' He began studies of what would happen if the system that clears market trades froze.\r\n''''We were halfway through the study,'''' one senior intelligence official said last month, ''''and the markets froze of their own accord. And we looked at each other and said, ''Our market collapse has just given every cyberwarrior out there a playbook.'' ''''\r\nJust before Mr. Obama was elected, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a policy research group in Washington, warned in a report that ''''America''s failure to protect cyberspace is one of the most urgent national security problems facing the new administration.''''\r\nWhat alarmed the panel was not the capabilities of individual hackers but of nations -- China and Russia among them -- that experts believe are putting huge resources into the development of cyberweapons. A research company called Team Cymru recently examined ''''scans'''' that came across the Internet seeking ways to get inside industrial control systems, and discovered more than 90 percent of them came from computers in China.\r\nScanning alone does no damage, but it could be the prelude to an attack that scrambles databases or seeks to control computers. But Team Cymru ran into a brick wall as soon as it tried to trace who, exactly, was probing these industrial systems. It could not determine whether military organizations, intelligence agencies, terrorist groups, criminals or inventive teenagers were behind the efforts.\r\nThe good news, some government officials argue, is that the Chinese are deterred from doing real damage: Because they hold more than a trillion dollars in United States government debt, they have little interest in freezing up a system they depend on for their own investments.\r\nThen again, some of the scans seemed to originate from 14 other countries, including Taiwan, Russia and, of course, the United States.\r\nBikini Atoll for an Online Age\r\nBecause ''''cyberwar'''' contains the word ''''war,'''' the Pentagon has argued that it should be the locus of American defensive and offensive strategy -- and it is creating the kind of infrastructure that was built around nuclear weapons in the 1940s and ''50s.\r\nDefense Secretary Robert M. Gates is considering proposals to create a Cyber Command -- initially as a new headquarters within the Strategic Command, which controls the American nuclear arsenal and assets in space. Right now, the responsibility for computer network security is part of Strategic Command, and military officials there estimate that over the past six months, the government has spent $100 million responding to probes and attacks on military systems. Air Force officials confirm that a large network of computers at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama was temporarily taken off-line within the past eight months when it was put at risk of widespread infection from computer viruses.\r\nBut Mr. Gates has concluded that the military''s cyberwarfare effort requires a sharper focus -- and thus a specific command. It would build the defenses for military computers and communications systems and -- the part the Pentagon is reluctant to discuss -- develop and deploy cyberweapons.\r\nIn fact, that effort is already under way -- it is part of what the National Cyber Range is all about. The range is a replica of the Internet of the future, and it is being built to be attacked. Competing teams of contractors -- including BAE Systems, the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University and Sparta Inc. -- are vying to build the Pentagon a system it can use to simulate attacks. The National Security Agency already has a smaller version of a similar system, in Millersville, Md.\r\nIn short, the Cyber Range is to the digital age what the Bikini Atoll -- the islands the Army vaporized in the 1950s to measure the power of the hydrogen bomb -- was to the nuclear age. But once the tests at Bikini Atoll demonstrated to the world the awesome destructive power of the bomb, it became evident to the United States and the Soviet Union -- and other nuclear powers -- that the risks of a nuclear exchange were simply too high. In the case of cyberattacks, where the results can vary from the annoying to the devastating, there are no such rules.\r\nThe Deterrence Conundrum\r\nDuring the cold war, if a strategic missile had been fired at the United States, screens deep in a mountain in Colorado would have lighted up and American commanders would have some time to decide whether to launch a counterattack. Today, when Pentagon computers are subjected to a barrage, the origin is often a mystery. Absent certainty about the source, it is almost impossible to mount a counterattack.\r\nIn the rare case where the preparations for an attack are detected in a foreign computer system, there is continuing debate about whether to embrace the concept of pre-emption, with all of its Bush-era connotations. The questions range from whether an online attack should be mounted on that system to, in an extreme case, blowing those computers up.\r\nSome officials argue that if the United States engaged in such pre-emption -- and demonstrated that it was watching the development of hostile cyberweapons -- it could begin to deter some attacks. Others believe it will only justify pre-emptive attacks on the United States. ''''Russia and China have lots of nationalistic hackers,'''' one senior military officer said. ''''They seem very, very willing to take action on their own.''''\r\nSenior Pentagon and military officials also express deep concern that the laws and understanding of armed conflict have not kept current with the challenges of offensive cyberwarfare.\r\nOver the decades, a number of limits on action have been accepted -- if not always practiced. One is the prohibition against assassinating government leaders. Another is avoiding attacks aimed at civilians. Yet in the cyberworld, where the most vulnerable targets are civilian, there are no such rules or understandings. If a military base is attacked, would it be a proportional, legitimate response to bring down the attacker''s power grid if that would also shut down its hospital systems, its air traffic control system or its banking system?\r\n''''We don''t have that for cyber yet,'''' one senior Defense Department official said, ''''and that''s a little bit dangerous.''''\r\nCyberwar: Computers, indispensable in peace, are becoming ever more important in political conflicts and open warfare.

Communications were down, and the chain of command was broken.\r\nPacing a makeshift bunker whose entrance was camouflaged with netting, the young man in battle fatigues barked at his comrades: ''''They are flooding the e-mail server. Block it. I''ll take the heat for it.''''\r\nThese are the war games at West Point, at least last month, when a team of cadets spent four days struggling around the clock to establish a computer network and keep it operating while hackers from the National Security Agency in Maryland tried to infiltrate it with methods that an enemy might use. The N.S.A. made the cadets'' task more difficult by planting viruses on some of the equipment, just as real-world hackers have done on millions of computers around the world.\r\nThe competition was a final exam of sorts for a senior elective class. The cadets, who were computer science and information technology majors, competed against teams from the Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard and Merchant Marine as well as the Naval Postgraduate School and the Air Force Institute of Technology. Each team was judged on how well it subdued the threats from the N.S.A.\r\nThe cyberwar games at West Point are just one example of a heightened awareness across the military that it must treat the threat of a computer attack as seriously as it does an attack carried out by a bomber or combat brigade. There is hardly an American military unit or headquarters that has not been ordered to analyze the risk of cyberattacks to its mission -- and to train to counter them. If the hackers were to succeed, they could change information on the network and cripple Internet communications.\r\nIn the desert outside Las Vegas, in a series of inconspicuous trailers, some of the most highly motivated hackers in the United States spend their days and nights probing the military''s vast computer networks for weaknesses to exploit.\r\nThese hackers -- many of whom got their start as teenagers devoted to computer screens in their basements -- have access to the latest in attack software. Some of it was developed by cryptologists at the N.S.A., the nation''s largest intelligence agency, where most of the government''s talent for breaking and making computer codes resides.\r\nThe hackers have an official name -- the 57th Information Aggressor Squadron -- and a real home, Nellis Air Force Base.\r\nThe Army last year created its own destination for computer experts, the Network Warfare Battalion, where many of the cadets in the cyberwar games hope to be assigned. But even so, the ranks are still small.\r\nThe Defense Department today graduates only 80 students a year from its cyberwar schools, causing Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates to complain that the Pentagon is ''''desperately short of people who have capabilities in this area in all the services, and we have to address it.'''' Under current Pentagon budget proposals, the number of students cycled through the schools will be quadrupled in the next two years.\r\nPart of the Pentagon''s effort to increase the military''s capabilities are the annual cyberwar games played at the nation''s military academies, including West Point, where young cadets in combat boots and buzz cuts talk megabytes instead of megatons on a campus dotted with statues of generals, historic armaments and old stone buildings.\r\nWhile the Pentagon has embraced the need for offensive cyberwarfare, there were no offensive maneuvers in the games last month, said Col. Joe Adams, who teaches Information Assurance and stood at the head of the classroom during the April exercise.\r\nCadet Joshua Ewing said he and his fellow Blue Team members ''''learn all the techniques that a hacker would do, and we try to beat a hacker.''''\r\nThese strategies are not just theoretical. Most of these cadets will soon be sent to Afghanistan to carry out such work, Cadet Ewing said.\r\nWhen the military deploys in a combat zone or during a domestic emergency, establishing a secure Internet connection is an early priority. To keep things humming, the military''s experts must fend off the ordinary chaos of the Internet as well as attacks devised to disable the communications system, like flooding e-mail servers with so many junk messages that they collapse.\r\nUnderscoring how seriously the cadets were taking the April games, the sign above the darkened entranceway in Thayer Hall read ''''Information Warfare Live Fire Range'''' and the area was draped with camouflage netting.\r\nOne group had to retrieve crucial information from a partly erased hard drive. One common method of hiding text, said Cadet Sean Storey, is to embed it in digital photographs; he had managed to find secret documents hidden this way. He was seeking a password needed to read encrypted e-mail he had located on the hard drive.\r\nOther cadets worked in tandem, as if plugging a leaky dam, to keep the entire system working as the N.S.A. hackers attacked the engine that runs a crucial database as well as the e-mail server.\r\nThey shouted out various Internet addresses to inspect -- and usually block -- after getting clearance from referees. And there was that awkward moment when the cadet in charge, Salvatore Messina, had to act without clearance because the attack was so severe he couldn''t even send an e-mail message.\r\nThe cadets in this room do get their share of ribbing. But one cadet, Derek Taylor, said today''s soldiers recognize that technological expertise can be as vital as brute force in saving lives. West Point takes the competition seriously. The cadets who helped install and secure the operating system spent a week setting it up. The dean gives a pep talk; professors bring food.\r\nBrian McCord, part of the team that installed the operating system, said he was chosen because his senior project was deeply reliant on Linux. The West Point team used this open-source operating system, freely available on the Internet, instead of relying on proprietary products from big-name companies like Microsoft or Sun Microsystems.\r\n''''It seems weird for the Army with its large contracts to be using Linux, but it''s very cheap and very customizable,'''' Cadet McCord said. It is also much easier to secure because ''''you can tweak it for everything you need'''' and there are not as many known ways to attack it, he said.\r\nWest Point emerged victorious in the games last month. That means the academy, which has won five of the last nine competitions, can keep the Director''s Cup trophy, which is displayed near a German Enigma encoding machine from World War II. Cracking the Enigma code helped the Allies win the war, and the machine is a stark reminder of the pivotal role of technology in warfare.\r\nCyberwar: Computers, indispensable in peace, are becoming ever more important in political conflicts and open warfare.

But senior Pentagon and military officials say that Mr. Obama''s assurances may be challenging to guarantee in practice, particularly in trying to monitor the thousands of daily attacks on security systems in the United States that have set off a race to develop better cyberweapons.\r\nMuch of the new military command''s work is expected to be carried out by the National Security Agency, whose role in intercepting the domestic end of international calls and e-mail messages after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, under secret orders issued by the Bush administration, has already generated intense controversy.\r\nThere is simply no way, the officials say, to effectively conduct computer operations without entering networks inside the United States, where the military is prohibited from operating, or traveling electronic paths through countries that are not themselves American targets.\r\nThe cybersecurity effort, Mr. Obama said at the White House last month, ''''will not -- I repeat, will not -- include monitoring private sector networks or Internet traffic.''''\r\nBut foreign adversaries often mount their attacks through computer network hubs inside the United States, and military officials and outside experts say that threat confronts the Pentagon and the administration with difficult questions.\r\nMilitary officials say there may be a need to intercept and examine some e-mail messages sent from other countries to guard against computer viruses or potential terrorist action. Advocates say the process could ultimately be accepted as the digital equivalent of customs inspections, in which passengers arriving from overseas consent to have their luggage opened for security, tax and health reasons.\r\n''''The government is in a quandary,'''' said Maren Leed, a defense expert at the bipartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies who was a Pentagon special assistant on cyberoperations from 2005 to 2008.\r\nMs. Leed said a broad debate was needed ''''about what constitutes an intrusion that violates privacy and, at the other extreme, what is an intrusion that may be acceptable in the face of an act of war.''''\r\nIn a recent speech, Gen. James E. Cartwright, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a chief architect of the new cyberstrategy, acknowledged that a major unresolved issue was how the military -- which would include the National Security Agency, where much of the cyberwar expertise resides -- could legally set up an early warning system.\r\nUnlike a missile attack, which would show up on the Pentagon''s screens long before reaching American territory, a cyberattack may be visible only after it has been launched in the United States.\r\n''''How do you understand sovereignty in the cyberdomain?'''' General Cartwright asked. ''''It doesn''t tend to pay a lot of attention to geographic boundaries.''''\r\nFor example, the daily attacks on the Pentagon''s own computer systems, or probes sent from Russia, China and Eastern Europe seeking chinks in the computer systems of corporations and financial institutions, are rarely seen before their effect is felt inside the United States.\r\nSome administration officials have begun to discuss whether laws or regulations must be changed to allow law enforcement, the military or intelligence agencies greater access to networks or Internet providers when significant evidence of a national security threat was found.\r\nMs. Leed said that while the Defense Department and related intelligence agencies were the only organizations that had the ability to protect against such cyberattacks, ''''they are not the best suited, from a civil liberties perspective, to take on that responsibility.''''\r\nUnder plans being completed at the Pentagon, the new cybercommand will be run by a four-star general, much the way Gen. David H. Petraeus runs the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from Central Command in Tampa, Fla. But the expectation is that whoever is in charge of the new command will also direct the National Security Agency, an effort to solve the turf war between the spy agency and the military over who is in charge of conducting offensive operations.\r\nWhile the N.S.A.''s job is chiefly one of detection and monitoring, the agency also possesses what Michael D. McConnell, the former director of national intelligence, called ''''the critical skill set'''' to respond quickly to cyberattacks. Yet the Defense Department views cyberspace as its domain as well, a new battleground after land, sea, air and space.\r\nThe complications are not limited to privacy concerns. The Pentagon is increasingly worried about the diplomatic ramifications of being forced to use the computer networks of many other nations while carrying out digital missions -- the computer equivalent of the Vietnam War''s spilling over the Cambodian border in the 1960s. To battle Russian hackers, for example, it might be necessary to act through the virtual cyberterritory of Britain or Germany or any country where the attack was routed.\r\nGeneral Cartwright said military planners were trying to write rules of engagement for scenarios in which a cyberattack was launched from a neutral country that might have no idea what was going on. But, with time of the essence, it may not be possible, the scenarios show, to ask other nations to act against an attack that is flowing through their computers in milliseconds.\r\n''''If I pass through your country, do I have to talk to the ambassador?'''' General Cartwright said. ''''It is very difficult. Those are the questions that are now really starting to emerge vis-a-vis cyber.''''\r\nFrida Berrigan, a longtime peace activist who is a senior program associate at the New America Foundation''s arms and security initiative, expressed concerns about whether the Obama administration would be able to balance its promise to respect privacy in cyberspace even as it appeared to be militarizing cybersecurity.\r\n''''Obama was very deliberate in saying that the U.S. military and the U.S. government would not be looking at our e-mail and not tracking what we do online,'''' Ms. Berrigan said. ''''This is not to say there is not a cyberthreat out there or that cyberterrorism is not a significant concern. We should be vigilant and creative. But once again we see the Pentagon being put at the heart of it and at front lines of offering a solution.''''\r\nMs. Berrigan said that just as the counterinsurgency wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had proved that ''''there is no front line anymore, and no demilitarized zone anymore, then if the Pentagon and the military services see cyberspace as a battlefield domain, then the lines protecting privacy and our civil liberties get blurred very, very quickly.''''', '');

These networks are poorly defended and vulnerable to theft, disruption or destruction by foreign states, criminal organizations, individual hackers and, potentially, terrorists. In the last few months it has been reported that Chinese network operations have found their way into American electricity grids, and computer spies have broken into the Pentagon''s Joint Strike Fighter project.\r\nAcknowledging such threats, President Obama recently declared that digital infrastructure is a ''''strategic national asset,'''' the protection of which is a national security priority.\r\nOne of many hurdles to meeting this goal is that the private sector owns and controls most of the networks the government must protect. In addition to banks, energy suppliers and telecommunication companies, military and intelligence agencies use these private networks. This is a dangerous state of affairs, because the firms that build and run computer and communications networks focus on increasing profits, not protecting national security. They invest in levels of safety that satisfy their own purposes, and tend not to worry when they contribute to insecure networks that jeopardize national security.\r\nThis is a classic market failure that only government leadership can correct. The tricky task is for the government to fix the problem in ways that do not stifle innovation or unduly hamper civil liberties.\r\nOur digital security problems start with ordinary computer users who do not take security seriously. Their computers can be infiltrated and used as vehicles for attacks on military or corporate systems. They are also often the first place that adversaries go to steal credentials or identify targets as a prelude to larger attacks.\r\nPresident Obama has recognized the need to educate the public about computer security. The government should jump-start this education by mandating minimum computer security standards and by requiring Internet service providers to deny or delay Internet access to computers that fall below these standards, or that are sending spam or suspicious multiple computer probes into the network.\r\nThe government should also use legal liability or tax breaks to motivate manufacturers -- especially makers of operating systems -- to improve vulnerability-filled software that infects the entire network. It should mandate disclosure of data theft and other digital attacks -- to trusted private parties, if not to the public or the government -- so that firms can share information about common weapons and best defenses, and so the public can better assess which firms'' computer systems are secure. Increased information production and sharing will also help create insurance markets that can elevate best security practices.\r\nBut the private sector cannot protect these networks by itself any more than it can protect the land, air or water channels through which foreign adversaries or criminal organizations might attack us. The government must be prepared to monitor and, if necessary, intervene to secure channels of cyberattack as well.\r\nThe Obama administration recently announced that it would set up a Pentagon cybercommand to defend military networks. Some in the administration want to use Cybercom to help the Department of Homeland Security protect the domestic components of private networks that are under attack or being used for attacks. Along similar lines, a Senate bill introduced in April would give the executive branch broad emergency authority to limit or halt private Internet traffic related to ''''critical infrastructure information systems.''''\r\nPresident Obama has tried to soothe civil liberties groups'' understandable worries about these proposals. In the speech that outlined the national security implications of our weak digital defenses, the president said the government would not monitor private sector networks or Internet traffic, and pledged to ''''preserve and protect the personal privacy and civil liberties we cherish as Americans.''''\r\nBut the president is less than candid about the tradeoffs the nation faces. The government must be given wider latitude than in the past to monitor private networks and respond to the most serious computer threats.\r\nThese new powers should be strictly defined and regularly vetted to ensure legal compliance and effectiveness. Last year''s amendments to the nation''s secret wiretapping regime are a useful model. They expanded the president''s secret wiretapping powers, but also required quasi-independent inspectors general in the Department of Justice and the intelligence community to review effectiveness and legal compliance and report to Congress regularly.\r\nMany will balk at this proposal because of the excesses and mistakes associated with the secret wiretapping regime in the Bush administration. These legitimate concerns can be addressed with improved systems of review.\r\nBut they should not prevent us from empowering the government to meet the cyber threats that jeopardize our national defense and economic security.

Sharon Otterman contributed reporting from New York.\r\n\r\nSECTION: Section ; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg.\r\n\r\nLENGTH: 914 words\r\n\r\nDATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea\r\n\r\nA wave of cyberattacks aimed at 27 American and South Korean government agencies and commercial Web sites temporarily jammed more than a third of them over the past five days, and several sites in South Korea came under renewed attack on Thursday.\r\nThe latest bout of attacks, which affected service on one government and six commercial Web sites in South Korea, was relatively minor, and all but two of the sites were fully functional within a few hours, said an official from the state-run Korea Communications Commission.\r\n''''An aggressive distribution of vaccine programs against the attack has helped fight back,'''' the official, Shin Hwa-soo, said. ''''But we are not keeping our guard down. We are distributing the vaccine programs as widely as possible and monitoring the situations closely because there might be a new attack.''''\r\nOfficials and computer experts in the United States said Wednesday that the attacks, which began over the July 4 weekend, were unsophisticated and on a relatively small scale, and that their origins had not been determined. They said 50,000 to 65,000 computers had been commandeered by hackers and ordered to flood specific Web sites with access requests, causing them to slow or stall. Such robotic networks, or botnets, can involve more than a million computers.\r\nThe Web sites of the Treasury Department, Secret Service, Federal Trade Commission and Transportation Department were all affected at some point over the weekend and into this week, The Associated Press reported Tuesday, citing American officials.\r\nA White House spokesman, Nick Shapiro, said in a statement on Wednesday that ''''all federal Web sites were back up and running'''' by Tuesday night and that the White House site had also been attacked.\r\nHe said, ''''The preventative measures in place to deal with frequent attempts to disrupt whitehouse.gov''s service performed as planned, keeping the site stable and available to the general public, although visitors from regions in Asia may have been affected.''''\r\nThe Web site of the New York Stock Exchange also came under attack, as well as the sites of Nasdaq, Yahoo''s finance section and The Washington Post.\r\nResearchers who are following the attacks said that they began July 4 and focused on the small group of United States government Web sites, but that the list later expanded to include commercial sites in the United States and then commercial and government sites in South Korea. Files stored on computers that are part of the attacking system show that 27 Web sites are now targets.\r\nIn South Korea, at least 11 major sites have slowed or crashed since Tuesday, including those of the presidential Blue House, the Defense Ministry, the National Assembly, Shinhan Bank, the mass-circulation newspaper Chosun Ilbo and the top Internet portal Naver.com, according to the government''s Korea Information Security Agency.\r\nOn Wednesday, some of the South Korean sites regained service, but others remained unstable or inaccessible.\r\n''''This is not a simple attack by an individual hacker, but appears to be thoroughly planned and executed by a specific organization or on a state level,'''' the South Korean spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, said in a statement, adding that it was cooperating with the American authorities to investigate the attacks.\r\nThe spy agency said the attacks appeared to have been carried out by a hostile group or government, and the news agency Yonhap reported that the agency had implicated North Korea or pro-North Korean groups.\r\nA spokesman at the intelligence agency said it could not confirm the Yonhap report about North Korea''s possible role. The opposition Democratic Party accused the spy agency of spreading rumors to whip up support for an antiterrorism bill that would give it more power.\r\nAlthough most of the North Korean military''s hardware is decrepit, the South Korean authorities have recently expressed concern over possible cyberattacks from the North. In May, South Korean media reported that North Korea was running a cyberwarfare unit that operated through the Chinese Internet network and tried to hack into American and South Korean military networks. United States computer security researchers who have examined the attacking software and watched network traffic played down the sophistication and extent of the attacks.\r\n''''I would call this a garden-variety attack,'''' said Jose Nazario, manager of security research at Arbor Networks, a network security firm that is based in Chelmsford, Mass. He said that the attackers were generating about 23 megabits of data a second, not enough to cause major disruptions of the Internet at most of the sites that were being attacked.\r\n''''The code is really pretty elementary in many respects,'''' he added. ''''I''m doubting that the author is a computer science graduate student.''''\r\nAs for possible origins, there were only hints. One researcher, Joe Stewart, of Secureworks'' Counter Threat Unit in Atlanta, said the attacking software contained the text string ''''get/China/DNS,'''' with DNS referring to China''s Internet routing system. He said that it appeared that the data generated by the attacking program was based on a Korean-language browser.\r\nAmy Kudwa, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said that the agency was aware of the attacks and that it had issued a notice to federal departments and agencies, as well as to other partner organizations, advising them of steps to take to help mitigate attacks.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: July 10, 2009\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\r\n', '');

The hackers harness the stolen resources into a scattered but powerful computer that can be used to send spam, execute phishing scams or steal digital information. These remote-controlled ''''distributed computers'''' are difficult to observe and track.\r\nBotnets may take over parts of tens of thousands or in some cases even millions of computers, making them among the world''s most powerful computers for some applications.\r\n''''When a forest is on fire you can fly over it, but with a cyberattack you have no clear idea of what it looks like,'''' said Ron Minnich, a Sandia scientist who specializes in computer security. ''''It''s an extremely difficult task to get a global picture.''''\r\nTo stalk the botnets, Mr. Minnich and his colleague Don Rudish have converted a Dell supercomputer to simulate a mini-Internet of one million computers.\r\nThe researchers said they hoped to be able to infect their digital petri dish with a botnet in October and then gather data on how the system behaves. One of the challenges will be in tricking the botnet components into believing they are running in the open Internet.\r\nSome botnet makers have designed their programs to detect so-called honey pots, programs that pretend to be computers that can be taken over but which instead are used to capture and observe botnet clients.\r\nTypically, supercomputers have been designed with the goal of reaching absolute computing performance, and used for complex scientific or engineering tasks like modeling the earth''s climate, protein folding or simulating nuclear weapons explosions.\r\nThe Sandia computer, which the researchers have named MegaTux, in a reference to Tux, the penguin character that is the official mascot of the Linux operating system, is an example of a new kind of computational science, in which computers are used to simulate scientific instruments that were once used in physical world laboratories. For example, Microsoft researchers have created a vast visualization database they call the world wide telescope.\r\n''''One of the advantages of such a system is that we can stop the simulation at any point and look for patterns,'''' Mr. Rudish said. ''''It''s one of the neat things you can do when you crash a simulation of a 747 on a supercomputer.''''\r\nIn the past, the researchers said, no one has tried to program a computer to simulate more than tens of thousands of operating systems.\r\nThe Dell Thunderbird supercomputer used for the Sandia project has 4,480 Intel microprocessors, far fewer than the million operating systems the researchers sought to simulate. But they used ''''virtual machine'''' software technology to get each microprocessor to simultaneously run many instances of a Linux-based component called a kernel -- a basic component of an operating system that manages communications between software and hardware.\r\nBecause most botnets are written for the Windows operating system, the researchers are planning to use an open source program called Wine, making it possible to run Windows-based programs without actually having the complete Windows operating system. They said they were not using Windows itself because of the licensing costs of purchasing one million copies of Windows.\r\nBesides simulating the Internet, Keith Vanderveen, manager of scaleable computing research at Sandia, said the system would be valuable for exploring the design of future supercomputers that might have millions rather than thousands of processors. It will also be invaluable for researchers who are hoping to design new, more secure protocols for the Internet.\r\n''''We will have a test bed where we will be able to try things out at Internet scale,'''' he said.\r\nThe researchers said they were collaborating with military contractors who are developing the National Cyber Range, a project financed by the Pentagon that is intended to be a testing ground for defensive techniques and new weapons developed for cyberwar.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: July 28, 2009\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: PHOTO: SUPERSIZED: The Dell Thunderbird supercomputer used for the Sandia National Laboratories botnet project has 4,480 Intel microprocessors.\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\r\n', '');

With more than five million of these zombies now under its control -- government, business and home computers in more than 200 countries -- this shadowy computer has power that dwarfs that of the world''s largest data centers.\r\nAlarmed by the program''s quick spread after its debut in November, computer security experts from industry, academia and government joined forces in a highly unusual collaboration. They decoded the program and developed antivirus software that erased it from millions of the computers. But Conficker''s persistence and sophistication has squelched the belief of many experts that such global computer infections are a thing of the past.\r\n''''It''s using the best current practices and state of the art to communicate and to protect itself,'''' Rodney Joffe, director of the Conficker Working Group, said of the malicious program. ''''We have not found the trick to take control back from the malware in any way.''''\r\nResearchers speculate that the computer could be employed to generate vast amounts of spam; it could steal information like passwords and logins by capturing keystrokes on infected computers; it could deliver fake antivirus warnings to trick naive users into believing their computers are infected and persuading them to pay by credit card to have the infection removed.\r\nThere is also a different possibility that concerns the researchers: That the program was not designed by a criminal gang, but instead by an intelligence agency or the military of some country to monitor or disable an enemy''s computers. Networks of infected computers, or botnets, were used widely as weapons in conflicts in Estonia in 2007 and in Georgia last year, and in more recent attacks against South Korean and United States government agencies. Recent attacks that temporarily crippled Twitter and Facebook were believed to have had political overtones.\r\nYet for the most part Conficker has done little more than to extend its reach to more and more computers. Though there had been speculation that the computer might be activated to do something malicious on April 1, the date passed without incident, and some security experts wonder if the program has been abandoned.\r\nThe experts have only tiny clues about the location of the program''s authors. The first version included software that stopped the program if it infected a machine with a Ukrainian language keyboard. There may have been two initial infections -- in Buenos Aires and in Kiev.\r\nWherever the authors are, the experts say, they are clearly professionals using the most advanced technology available. The program is protected by internal defense mechanisms that make it hard to erase, and even kills or hides from programs designed to look for botnets.\r\nA member of the security team said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had suspects, but was moving slowly because it needed to build a relationship with ''''noncorrupt'''' law enforcement agencies in the countries where the suspects are located.\r\nAn F.B.I. spokesman in Washington declined to comment, saying that the Conficker investigation was an open case.\r\nThe first infections, last Nov. 20, set off an intense battle between the hidden authors and the volunteer group that formed to counter them. The group, which first called itself the ''''Conficker Cabal,'''' changed its name when Microsoft, Symantec and several other companies objected to the unprofessional connotation.\r\nEventually, university researchers and law enforcement officials joined forces with computer experts at more than two dozen Internet, software and computer security firms.\r\nThe group won some battles, but lost others. The Conficker authors kept distributing new, more intricate versions of the program, at one point using code that had been devised in academia only months before. At another point, a single technical slip by the working group allowed the program''s authors to convert a huge number of the infected machines to an advanced peer-to-peer communications scheme that the industry group has not been able to defeat. Where before all the infected computers would have to phone home to a single source for instructions, the authors could now use any infected computer to instruct all the others.\r\nIn early April, Patrick Peterson, a research fellow at Cisco Systems in San Jose, Calif., gained some intelligence about the authors'' interests. He studies nasty computer programs by keeping a set of quarantined computers that capture and observe them -- his ''''digital zoo.''''\r\nHe discovered that the Conficker authors had begun distributing software that tricks Internet users into buying fake antivirus software with their credit cards. ''''We turned off the lights in the zoo one day and came back the next day,'''' Mr. Peterson said, noting that in the ''''cage'''' reserved for Conficker, the infection had been joined by a program distributing an antivirus software scam.\r\nIt was the most recent sign of life from the program, and its silence has set off a debate among computer security experts. Some researchers think Conficker is an empty shell, or that the authors of the program were scared away in the spring. Others argue that they are simply biding their time.\r\nIf the misbegotten computer were reactivated, it would not have the problem-solving ability of supercomputers used to design nuclear weapons or simulate climate change. But because it has commandeered so many machines, it could draw on an amount of computing power greater than that from any single computing facility run by governments or Google. It is a dark reflection of the ''''cloud computing'''' sweeping the commercial Internet, in which data is stored on the Internet rather than on a personal computer.\r\nThe industry group continues to try to find ways to kill Conficker, meeting as recently as Tuesday. Mr. Joffe said he, for one, was not prepared to declare victory. But he said that the group''s work proved that government and private industry could cooperate to counter cyberthreats.\r\n''''Even if we lose against Conficker,'''' he said, ''''there are things we''ve learned that will benefit us in the future.''''\r\nZombie Networks: Computers, indispensable in peace, are becoming ever more important in political conflicts and open warfare.

Now the military presence is growing again. This time, though, the new force will not comprise fighters, bombers or boots on the ground. Instead, the city is hosting the fastest-growing domain of government and military spending: cyberwarfare.\r\nThe Air Force''s new military command for computer-network offense and defense, activated in late summer, is expected to require 5,500 to 7,000 jobs, including Air Force personnel, Defense Department civilians and private-sector contractors.\r\nLackland Air Force Base here was named home for the new Air Force cyberwarfare operation after a competition that pitted San Antonio against communities with better-known bases in Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Nebraska and Virginia.\r\nIn fact, when the Air Force began looking for a place to base its new headquarters for computer-network warfare, officially called the 24th Air Force, San Antonio was not even on the list.\r\n''''But we had a secret weapon -- a lot of retired colonels, lieutenant colonels and majors who had shed their uniforms and now are in key positions at the Chamber of Commerce and all across the business community,'''' said John B. Dickson of Denim Group, a computer software and network security firm here. ''''They were able to make the business case very strongly in San Antonio''s favor.''''\r\nThe Obama administration this year elevated computer-network warfare to be its high frontier of national security priorities, with far-reaching effects on military operations -- and how the Pentagon does business.\r\nSan Antonio''s experience in lobbying for the new headquarters proved how the traditional ''''Iron Triangle'''' of military contracting -- the Pentagon, Congress and the military industry -- is being replaced by a new silicon circle that requires harnessing the efforts of municipal governments, business leaders and universities to ride the next wave of large military contracts.\r\n''''You have to pull together all the disparate interests in your community -- academic interests, public-sector utilities, the military, other federal agencies already operating in town and the business community,'''' said Matt Pirko of ManTech Security and Mission Assurance, another local computer-network firm.\r\nJulian Castro, the mayor of San Antonio, said community leaders found it easy to sell the lobbying effort, not just in Washington but to their own citizens. San Antonio has a history of energetically supporting its military bases, he said. But even more, cyberoperations are viewed as a more intellectual and clean, even ''''green,'''' sector of the American military than traditional combat.\r\nMr. Castro said the effort to sway decision makers was built on arguments that San Antonio not only offered excellent computer security expertise and the municipal infrastructure to support it, but was producing network warriors for the future through new programs at its high schools and local colleges.\r\nRavi Sandhu, executive director of the Institute for Cyber Security, at the University of Texas at San Antonio, said the recession had forced the state to cut back money for a number of academic programs, but not in computer security, and not here.\r\nOne draw for the Air Force was the institute''s Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security, which developed the ''''Dark Screen'''' exercise adopted by municipalities in 11 states to learn how to protect critical city infrastructure from computer-network attacks.\r\nThe center''s assistant director, Dwayne Williams, said his program was being used in so many cities, including several that competed for the new Air Force command, that his organization was prohibited from assisting hometown officials in making the pitch to the Air Force because of insider knowledge on weaknesses in computer security systems of those other cities.\r\nAt Lackland Air Force Base, signs have been going up, identifying the new 24th Air Force headquarters and its subordinate units, the 688th Information Operations Wing and the 67th Network Warfare Wing. The new headquarters will command two other communications groups, based in Galveston, Tex., and Oklahoma City.\r\nMaj. Gen. Richard E. Webber, commander of the 24th Air Force, said the choice of San Antonio was based on ''''proximity to other cyberoperational missions, as well as access to communications and bandwidth capabilities, infrastructure and the local scientific and technical base.''''\r\nIt did not hurt that the National Security Agency already has significant operations in San Antonio, including a unit of its Central Security Service, whose missions include protecting government computer systems and producing foreign signals intelligence.\r\nWithin the alphabet soup of American spy agencies, the N.S.A. takes the lead in electronic intelligence and computer-network warfare. Its director is expected to be assigned the second task of being in charge of the Pentagon''s new United States Cybercommand, overseeing militarywide computer-network operations. The 24th Air Force will be the service''s operation in support of that command''s mission.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: November 1, 2009\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: PHOTO: Mayor Julian Castro, left, of San Antonio said his city offered military decision makers excellent computer security expertise.(PHOTOGRAPH BY ERICH SCHLEGEL FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\r\n', '');

It has been demoralizing to see President Obama hiding from the Dalai Lama rather than offend China''s rulers.\r\nSo all that makes Google''s decision to stand up to Chinese cyberoppression positively breathtaking. By announcing that it no longer plans to censor search results in China, even if that means it must withdraw from the country, Google is showing spine -- a kind that few other companies or governments have shown toward Beijing.\r\nOne result was immediate: Young Chinese have been visiting Google''s headquarters in Beijing to deposit flowers and pay their respects.\r\nChina promptly tried to censor the ensuing debate about its censorship, but many Chinese Twitter users went out of their way to praise Google. One from Guangdong declared: ''''It''s not Google that''s withdrawing from China, it''s China that''s withdrawing from the world.''''\r\nCynics say that Google tried to turn a business setback (it lags in the Chinese market behind a local search engine, Baidu) into a bid to burnish its brand. Whatever the motivations, it marks a refreshing contrast to Yahoo assisting the Chinese government in sending four dissidents -- Shi Tao, Li Zhi, Jiang Lijun and Wang Xiaoning -- to prison for terms of up to 10 years.\r\n''''In the 20 years I''ve been doing this work, I can''t think of anything comparable,'''' said John Kamm, the founder of the Dui Hua Foundation, which has enjoyed remarkable success in encouraging China to release dissidents. Mr. Kamm, a former business leader himself, argues that Western companies could do far more to project their values.\r\nGoogle announced its decision after a sophisticated Chinese attempt to penetrate the Gmail addresses of dissidents. The episode and the resulting flap highlight two important points about China.\r\nThe first is that Beijing is increasingly devoting itself to cyberwarfare. This is a cheap way to counter American dominance in traditional military fields. If the U.S. and China ever jostle with force, Beijing may hit us not with missiles but with cyberinfiltrations that shut down the electrical grid, disrupt communications and tinker with the floodgates of dams.\r\nMoreover, China''s leaders aren''t keeping their cyberarsenal in reserve. They seem to be using it aggressively already.\r\nA major coordinated assault on computers of the Dalai Lama, foreign embassies and even foreign ministries was uncovered last year and traced to Chinese hackers. The operation targeted computers in more than 100 countries and was so widespread that Western intelligence experts believe it was organized by the Chinese government, although there is no definitive proof of that.\r\n(If this column is replaced on nytimes.com with one under my byline praising the glorious courage of the Chinese Communist Party in standing up to the bourgeois imperialists of Google -- well, that would make my case.)\r\nA second point is that China is redrawing the balance between openness and economic efficiency. The architect of China''s astonishingly successful economic reforms, Deng Xiaoping, clenched his teeth and accepted photocopiers, fax machines, cellphones, computers and lawyers because they were part of modernization.\r\nYet in the last few years, President Hu Jintao has cracked down on Internet freedoms and independent lawyers and journalists. President Hu is intellectually brilliant but seems to have no vision for China 20 years from now. He seems to be the weakest Chinese leader since Hua Guofeng was stripped of power in 1978.\r\nInstead, vision and leadership in China have come from its Netizens, who show none of the lame sycophancy that so many foreigners do. In their Twitter photos, many display yellow ribbons to show solidarity with Liu Xiaobo, a Chinese writer recently sentenced to 10 years in prison. That''s guts!\r\nChina''s Netizens scale the Great Firewall of China with virtual private networks and American-based proxy servers like Freegate. (The United States should support these efforts with additional server capacity as a way of promoting free information and undermining censorship by China and Iran).\r\nYoung Chinese also are infinitely creative. When the government blocks references to ''''June 4,'''' the date of the Tiananmen Square massacre, Netizens evade the restriction by typing in ''''May 35.''''\r\nWhen I lived China in the 1990s, an early computer virus would pop up on the screen and ask: Do you like Li Peng? (He was then the widely disliked hard-line prime minister.) If you said you didn''t like Li Peng, the virus disappeared and did no harm. If you expressed support for him, it tried to wipe out your hard drive.\r\nEventually, I think, a combination of technology, education and information will end the present stasis in China. In a conflict between the Communist Party and Google, the party will win in the short run. But in the long run, I''d put my money on Google.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: January 14, 2010\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nDOCUMENT-TYPE: Op-Ed\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\r\n', '');

The enemy had all the advantages: stealth, anonymity and unpredictability. No one could pinpoint the country from which the attack came, so there was no effective way to deter further damage by threatening retaliation. What''s more, the military commanders noted that they even lacked the legal authority to respond -- especially because it was never clear if the attack was an act of vandalism, an attempt at commercial theft or a state-sponsored effort to cripple the United States, perhaps as a prelude to a conventional war.\r\n\r\nWhat some participants in the simulation knew -- and others did not -- was that a version of their nightmare had just played out in real life, not at the Pentagon where they were meeting, but in the far less formal war rooms at Google Inc. Computers at Google and more than 30 other companies had been penetrated, and Google''s software engineers quickly tracked the source of the attack to seven servers in Taiwan, with footprints back to the Chinese mainland.\r\n\r\nAfter that, the trail disappeared into a cloud of angry Chinese government denials, and then an ugly exchange of accusations between Washington and Beijing. That continued Monday, with Chinese assertions that critics were trying to ''''denigrate China'''' and that the United States was pursuing ''''hegemonic domination'''' in cyberspace.\r\n\r\nThese recent events demonstrate how quickly the nation''s escalating cyberbattles have outpaced the rush to find a deterrent, something equivalent to the cold-war-era strategy of threatening nuclear retaliation.\r\n\r\nSo far, despite millions of dollars spent on studies, that quest has failed. Last week, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made the most comprehensive effort yet to warn potential adversaries that cyberattacks would not be ignored, drawing on the language of nuclear deterrence.\r\n\r\n''''States, terrorists and those who would act as their proxies must know that the United States will protect our networks,'''' she declared in a speech on Thursday that drew an angry response from Beijing. ''''Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy, our government and our civil society.''''\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Clinton did not say how the United States would respond, beyond suggesting that countries that knowingly permit cyberattacks to be launched from their territories would suffer damage to their reputations, and could be frozen out of the global economy.\r\n\r\nThere is, in fact, an intense debate inside and outside the government about what the United States can credibly threaten. One alternative could be a diplomatic demarche, or formal protest, like the one the State Department said was forthcoming, but was still not delivered, in the Google case. Economic retaliation and criminal prosecution are also possibilities.\r\n\r\nInside the National Security Agency, which secretly scours overseas computer networks, officials have debated whether evidence of an imminent cyberattack on the United States would justify a pre-emptive American cyberattack -- something the president would have to authorize. In an extreme case, like evidence that an adversary was about to launch an attack intended to shut down power stations across America, some officials argue that the right response might be a military strike.\r\n\r\n''''We are now in the phase that we found ourselves in during the early 1950s, after the Soviets got the bomb,'''' said Joseph Nye, a professor at the Kennedy School at Harvard. ''''It won''t have the same shape as nuclear deterrence, but what you heard Secretary Clinton doing was beginning to explain that we can create some high costs for attackers.''''\r\n\r\nFighting Shadows\r\n\r\nWhen the Pentagon summoned its top regional commanders from around the globe for meetings and a dinner with President Obama on Jan. 11, the war game prepared for them had nothing to do with Afghanistan, Iraq or Yemen. Instead, it was the simulated cyberattack -- a battle unlike any they had engaged in.\r\n\r\nParticipants in the war game emerged with a worrisome realization. Because the Internet has blurred the line between military and civilian targets, an adversary can cripple a country -- say, freeze its credit markets -- without ever taking aim at a government installation or a military network, meaning that the Defense Department''s advanced capabilities may not be brought to bear short of a presidential order.\r\n\r\n''''The fact of the matter,'''' said one senior intelligence official, ''''is that unless Google had told us about the attack on it and other companies, we probably never would have seen it. When you think about that, it''s really scary.''''\r\n\r\nWilliam J. Lynn III, the deputy defense secretary, who oversaw the simulation, said in an interview after the exercise that America''s concepts for protecting computer networks reminded him of one of defensive warfare''s great failures, the Maginot Line of pre-World War II France.\r\n\r\nMr. Lynn, one of the Pentagon''s top strategists for computer network operations, argues that the billions spent on defensive shields surrounding America''s banks, businesses and military installations provide a similarly illusory sense of security.\r\n\r\n''''A fortress mentality will not work in cyber,'''' he said. ''''We cannot retreat behind a Maginot Line of firewalls. We must also keep maneuvering. If we stand still for a minute, our adversaries will overtake us.''''\r\n\r\nThe Pentagon simulation and the nearly simultaneous real-world attacks on Google and more than 30 other companies show that those firewalls are falling fast. But if it is obvious that the government cannot afford to do nothing about such breaches, it is also clear that the old principles of retaliation -- you bomb Los Angeles, we''ll destroy Moscow -- just do not translate.\r\n\r\n''''We are looking beyond just the pure military might as the solution to every deterrence problem,'''' said Gen. Kevin P. Chilton, in charge of the military''s Strategic Command, which defends military computer networks. ''''There are other elements of national power that can be brought to bear. You could deter a country with some economic moves, for example.''''\r\n\r\nBut first you would have to figure out who was behind the attack.\r\n\r\nEven Google''s engineers could not track, with absolute certainty, the attackers who appeared to be trying to steal their source code and, perhaps, insert a ''''Trojan horse'''' -- a backdoor entryway to attack -- in Google''s search engines. Chinese officials have denied their government was involved, and said nothing about American demands that it investigate. China''s denials, American officials say, are one reason that President Obama has said nothing in public about the attacks -- a notable silence, given that he has made cybersecurity a central part of national security strategy.\r\n\r\n''''You have to be quite careful about attributions and accusations,'''' said a senior administration official deeply involved in dealing with the Chinese incident with Google. The official was authorized by the Obama administration to talk about its strategy, with the condition that he would not be named.\r\n\r\n''''It''s the nature of these attacks thatthe forensics are difficult,'''' the official added. ''''The perpetrator can mask their involvement, or disguise it as another country''s.'''' Those are known as ''''false flag'''' attacks, and American officials worry about being fooled by a dissident group, or a criminal gang, into retaliating against the wrong country.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the White House said in a statement that ''''deterrence has been a fundamental part of the administration''s cybersecurity efforts from the start,'''' citing work in the past year to protect networks and ''''international engagement to influence the behavior of potential adversaries.''''\r\n\r\nLeft unsaid is whether the Obama administration has decided whether it would ever threaten retaliatory cyberattacks or military attacks after a major cyberattack on American targets. The senior administration official provided by the White House, asked about Mr. Obama''s thinking on the issue, said: ''''Like most operational things like this, the less said, the better.'''' But he added, ''''there are authorities to deal with these attacks residing in many places, and ultimately, of course, with the president.''''\r\n\r\nOthers are less convinced. ''''The U.S. is widely recognized to have pre-eminent offensive cybercapabilities, but it obtains little or no deterrent effect from this,'''' said James A. Lewis, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies program on technology and public policy.\r\n\r\nIn its final years, the Bush administration started a highly classified effort, led by Melissa Hathaway, to build the foundations of a national cyberdeterrence strategy. ''''We didn''t even come close,'''' she said in a recent interview. Her hope had been to recreate Project Solarium, which President Dwight D. Eisenhower began in the sunroom of the White House in 1953, to come up with new ways of thinking about the nuclear threats then facing the country. ''''There was a lot of good work done, but it lacked the rigor of the original Solarium Project. They didn''t produce what you need to do decision making.''''\r\n\r\nMs. Hathaway was asked to stay on to run Mr. Obama''s early review. Yet when the unclassified version of its report was published in the spring, there was little mention of deterrence. She left the administration when she was not chosen as the White House cybersecurity coordinator. After a delay of seven months, that post is now filled: Howard A. Schmidt, a veteran computer specialist, reported for work last week, just as the government was sorting through the lessons of the Google attack and calculating its chances of halting a more serious one in the future.\r\n\r\nGovernment-Corporate Divide\r\n\r\nIn nuclear deterrence, both the Americans and the Soviets knew it was all or nothing: the Cuban missile crisis was resolved out of fear of catastrophic escalation. But in cyberattacks, the damage can range from the minor to the catastrophic, from slowing computer searches to bringing down a country''s cellphone networks, neutralizing its spy satellites, or crashing its electrical grid or its air traffic control systems. It is difficult to know if small attacks could escalate into bigger ones.\r\n\r\nSo part of the problem is to calibrate a response to the severity of the attack.\r\n\r\nThe government has responded to the escalating cyberattacks by ordering up new strategies and a new United States Cyber Command. The office of Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates -- whose unclassified e-mail system was hacked in 2007 -- is developing a ''''framework document'''' that would describe the threat and potential responses, and perhaps the beginnings of a deterrence strategy to parallel the one used in the nuclear world.\r\n\r\nThe new Cyber Command, if approved by Congress, would be run by Lt. Gen. Keith B. Alexander, head of the National Security Agency. Since the agency spies on the computer systems of foreign governments and terrorist groups, General Alexander would, in effect, be in charge of both finding and, if so ordered, neutralizing cyberattacks in the making.\r\n\r\nBut many in the military, led by General Chilton of the Strategic Command and Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have been urging the United States to think more broadly about ways to deter attacks by threatening a country''s economic well-being or its reputation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clinton went down that road in her speech on Thursday, describing how a country that cracked down on Internet freedom or harbored groups that conduct cyberattacks could be ostracized. But though sanctions might work against a small country, few companies are likely to shun a market the size of China, or Russia, because they disapprove of how those governments control cyberspace or use cyberweapons.\r\n\r\nThat is what makes the Google-China standoff so fascinating. Google broke the silence that usually surrounds cyberattacks; most American banks or companies do not want to admit their computer systems were pierced. Google has said it will stop censoring searches conducted by Chinese, even if that means being thrown out of China. The threat alone is an attempt at deterrence: Google''s executives are essentially betting that Beijing will back down, lift censorship of searches and crack down on the torrent of cyberattacks that pour out of China every day. If not, millions of young Chinese will be deprived of the Google search engine, and be left to the ones controlled by the Chinese government.\r\n\r\nAn Obama administration official who has been dealing with the Chinese mused recently, ''''You could argue that Google came up with a potential deterrent for the Chinese before we did.''''\r\n\r\nCyberwar: Computers, indispensable in peace, are becoming ever more important in political conflicts and open warfare.

The room itself is enclosed in a building full of computers and routers. What Mr. Pozar does there is to informally wire together the networks of different businesses that want to freely share their Internet traffic.\r\n\r\nThe practice is known as peering, and it goes back to the earliest days of the Internet, when organizations would directly connect their networks instead of paying yet another company to route data traffic. Originally, the companies that owned the backbone of the Internet shared traffic. In recent years, however, the practice has increased to the point where some researchers who study the way global networks are put together believe that peering is changing the fundamental shape of the Internet, with serious consequences for its stability and security. Others see the vast increase in traffic staying within a structure that has remained essentially the same. \r\n\r\nWhat is clear is that today a significant portion of Internet traffic does not flow through the backbone networks of giant Internet companies like AT&T and Level 3. Instead, it has begun to cascade in torrents of data on the edges of the network, as if a river in flood were carving new channels.\r\n\r\nSome of this traffic coursing through new channels passes through public peering points like Mr. Pozar''s. And some flows through so-called dark networks, private channels created to move information more cheaply and efficiently within a business or any kind of organization. For instance, Google has privately built such a network so that video and search data need not pass through so many points to get to customers.\r\n\r\nBy its very nature, Internet networking technology is intended to support anarchic growth. Unlike earlier communication networks, the Internet is not controlled from the top down. This stems from an innovation at the heart of the Internet -- packet switching. From the start, the information moving around the Internet was broken up into so-called packets that could be sent on different paths to one destination where the original message -- whether it was e-mail, an image or sound file or instructions to another computer -- would be put back together in its original form. This packet-switching technology was conceived in the 1960s in England and the United States. It made delivery of a message through a network possible even if one or many of the nodes of the network failed. Indeed, this resistance to failure or attack was at the very core of the Internet, part of the essential nature of an organic, interconnected communications web with no single control point.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1970s, a method emerged to create a network of networks. The connections depended on a communication protocol, or set of rules, known as TCP/IP, a series of letters familiar to anyone who has tried to set up their own wireless network at home. The global network of networks, the Internet, transformed the world, and continues to grow without central planning, extending itself into every area of life, from Facebook to cyberwar. \r\n\r\nEveryone agrees that the shape of the network is changing rapidly, driven by a variety of factors, including content delivery networks that have pushed both data and applications to the edge of the network; the growing popularity of smartphones leading to the emergence of the wireless Internet; and the explosion of streaming video as the Internet''s predominant data type.\r\n\r\n''''When we started releasing data publicly, we measured it in petabytes of traffic,'''' said Doug Webster, a Cisco Systems market executive who is responsible for an annual report by the firm that charts changes in the Internet. ''''Then a couple of years ago we had to start measuring them in zettabytes, and now we''re measuring them in what we call yottabytes.'''' One petabyte is equivalent to one million gigabytes. A zettabyte is a million petabytes. And a yottabyte is a thousand zettabytes. The company estimates that video will account for 90 percent of all Internet traffic by 2013.\r\n\r\nThe staggering growth of video is figuring prominently in political and business debates like the one over the principle of network neutrality -- that all data types, sites and platforms attached to the network should be treated equally. But networks increasingly treat data types differently. Priority is often given to video or voice traffic. \r\n\r\nA study presented last year by Arbor Networks suggesting that traffic flows were moving away from the core of the network touched off a spirited controversy. The study was based on an analysis of two years of Internet traffic data collected by 110 large and geographically diverse cable operators, international transit backbones, regional networks and content providers.\r\n\r\nArbor''s Internet Observatory Report concluded that today the majority of Internet traffic by volume flows directly between large content providers like Google and consumer networks like Comcast. It also described what it referred to as the rise of so-called hyper giants -- monstrous portals that have become the focal point for much of the network''s traffic: ''''Out of the 40,000 routed end sites in the Internet, 30 large companies -- ''hyper giants'' like Limelight, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and YouTube -- now generate and consume a disproportionate 30 percent of all Internet traffic,'''' the researchers noted.\r\n\r\nThe changes are not happening just because of the growth of the hyper giants.\r\n\r\nAt the San Francisco data center 365 Main, Mr. Pozar''s SFMIX peering location, or fabric, as it is called, now connects just 13 networks and content providers. But elsewhere in the world, huge peering fabrics are beginning to emerge. As a result, the ''''edge'''' of the Internet is thickening, and that may be adding resilience to the network. \r\n\r\nIn Europe in particular, such connection points now route a significant part of the total traffic. AMS-IX is based in Amsterdam, where it is also run as a nonprofit neutral organization composed of 344 members exchanging 775 gigabits of traffic per second.\r\n\r\n''''The rise of these highly connected data centers around the world is changing our model of the Internet,'''' said Jon M. Kleinberg, a computer scientist and network theorist at Cornell University. However, he added that the rise of giant distributed data centers built by Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and others as part of the development of cloud computing services is increasing the part of the network that constitutes a so-called dark Internet, making it harder for researchers to build a complete model.\r\n\r\nAll of these changes have sparked a debate about the big picture. What does the Internet look like now? And is it stronger or weaker in terms of its resistance to failure because of random problems or actual attack.\r\n\r\nResearchers have come up with a dizzying array of models to explain the consequences of the changing shape of the Internet. Some describe the interconnections of the underlying physical wires. Others analyze patterns of data flow. And still others look at abstract connections like Web page links that Google and other search engine companies analyze as part of the search process. Such models are of great interest to social scientists, who can watch how people connect with each other, and entrepreneurs, who can find new ways to profit from the Internet. They are also of increasing interest to government and law enforcement organizations trying to secure the Net and use it as a surveillance tool. \r\n\r\nOne of the first and most successful attempts to understand the overall shape of the Internet occurred a decade ago, when Albert-Laszlo Barabasi and colleagues at the University of Notre Dame mapped part of the Internet and discovered what they called a scale-free network: connections were not random; instead, a small number of nodes had far more links than most.\r\n\r\nThey asserted that, in essence, the rich get richer. The more connected a node in a network is, the more likely it is to get new connections.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of such a model are that although the Internet is resistant to random failure because of its many connections and control points, it could be vulnerable to cyberwarfare or terrorism, because important points -- where the connections are richest -- could be successfully targeted.\r\n\r\nDr. Barabasi said the evolution of the Internet has only strengthened his original scale-free model. ''''The Internet as we know it is pretty much vanishing, in the sense that much of the traffic is being routed through lots of new layers and applications, much of it wireless,'''' said Dr. Barabasi, a physicist who is now the director of Northeastern University''s Center for Network Science. ''''Much of the traffic is shifting to providers who have large amounts of traffic, and that is exactly the characteristic of a scale-free distribution.''''\r\n\r\nIn other words, the more the Internet changes, the more it stays the same, in terms of its overall shape, strengths and vulnerabilities. \r\n\r\nOther researchers say changes in the Internet have been more fundamental. In 2005, and again last year, Walter Willinger, a mathematician at AT&T Labs, David Alderson, an operations research scientist at the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey, Calif., and John C. Doyle, an electrical engineer at California Institute of Technology, criticized the scale-free model as an overly narrow interpretation of the nature of modern computer networks.\r\n\r\nThey argued that the mathematical description of a network as a graph of lines and nodes vastly oversimplifies the reality of the Internet. The real-world Internet, they said, is not a simple scale-free model. Instead, they offered an alternate description that they described as an H.O.T. network, or Highly optimized/Organized tolerance/Trade-offs. The Internet is an example of what they called ''''organized complexity.'''' Their model is meant to represent the trade-offs made by engineers who design networks by connecting computer routers. In such systems, both economic and technological trade-offs play an important role. The result is a ''''robust yet fragile'''' network that they said was far more resilient than the network described by Dr. Barabasi and colleagues. \r\n\r\nFor example, they noted that Google has in recent years built its own global cloud of computers that is highly redundant and distributed around the world. This degree of separation means that Google is insulated to some extent from problems of the broader Internet. Dr. Alderson and Dr. Doyle said that another consequence of this private cloud was that even if Google were to fail, it would have little impact on the overall Internet. So, as the data flood has carved many new channels, the Internet has become stronger and more resistant to random failure and attack.\r\n\r\nThe scale-free theorists, Dr. Alderson said, are just not describing the real Internet. ''''What they''re measuring is not the physical network, its some virtual abstraction that''s on top of it,'''' he said. ''''What does the virtual connectivity tell you about the underlying physical vulnerability? My argument would be that it doesn''t tell you anything.'''' \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: March 2, 2010\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: DRAWINGS (DRAWINGS BY JOHN HERSEY) (D1\r\nD4) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\r\n\r\n\r\n', '');

In recent months the government has carried out cyberwarfare against the opposition, eliminating virtually all sources of independent news and information and shutting down social networking services. \r\n\r\nThe sanctions against online services -- provided through free software like Google Chat or Yahoo Messenger -- were intended to restrict Iran''s ability to develop nuclear technology, but democracy advocates say they ended up helping the government repress its people. ''''The policies were contradictory,'''' said Ali Akbar Moussavi Khoini, a former member of Parliament who now lives in Washington, where he pressed for the change. \r\n\r\nThe new measure will enable users in Iran to download the latest circumvention software to help defeat the government''s efforts to block Web sites, and to stop relying on pirated copies that can be far more easily hacked by the government.\r\n\r\nBut the government''s opponents say they need still more help in getting around the government''s information roadblocks.\r\n\r\n''''The Islamic Republic is very efficient in limiting people''s access to these sources, and Iranian people need major help,'''' said Mehdi Yahyanejad, the founder of one of the largest Persian-language social networking Web sites, the United States-based Balatarin. ''''We need some 50 percent of people to be able to access independent news sources other than the state-controlled media.'''' \r\n\r\nWeb sites, social networking and satellite television became major sources of news and tools for organizing and mobilizing people. The opposition posted news about the demonstrations and videos of the security forces'' use of violence against protesters. A video of her final moments turned Neda Agha Soltan, the 26-year-old woman who was shot by government forces, into an international symbol.\r\n\r\nBut the authorities came to realize the significance of the networking tools and began efforts to eliminate them. In December its ''''cyberarmy'''' attacked Twitter, which was a major communications tool for the opposition. The hackers redirected Twitter users to a page in English that read, ''''This page has been hacked by the Iranian cyberarmy.''''\r\n\r\nIn recent months the government slowed the Internet to a crawl, so that users were unable to perform the simplest operations, like opening Gmail or Yahoo accounts. It has become impossible to post a video, and opposition Web sites have been blocked. The government has also jammed opposition and news satellite channels, including Persian-language Voice of America television and BBC Persian, which were watched by millions.\r\n\r\nThe government has jailed many cyberexperts in recent months, charging some with ''''waging war against God,'''' potentially a capital crime, for sending political e-mail messages. This month Parliament announced a $500 million budget for cyberwarfare, the Fars news agency recently reported.\r\n\r\nThe opposition tried to fight back with software designed to circumvent the restrictions, but that became a losing battle after Internet service was slowed.\r\n\r\nOpposition leaders say they would like to have access to Internet hardware -- any products made by Cisco Systems, for example, are subject to sanctions -- and high-speed satellite Internet service, which experts say is generally harder to jam than broadcasts. That service is available from the American company Hughes Global Services, in Europe and the Middle East, and could be used by Iranians. But Payam Herischi, senior director at Hughes, said that the company was reluctant to allow its satellites to provide service to Iran until sanctions are lifted.\r\n\r\nIran, which has no communications satellites of its own, is dependent on foreign companies for broadcasting all its local channels as well as English, Persian and Arabic channels. Its jamming of BBC Persian and Voice of America violated international regulations.\r\n\r\n''''What Iran is doing can cause serious chaos in the international satellite order,'''' said Sadeq Saba, the director of Persian-language BBC television. ''''If other countries begin to retaliate and jam Iran''s channels, there will be serious chaos.''''\r\n\r\nAfter Iranian jamming last December of the Voice of America and the BBC, the French company Eutelsat duplicated the services, which were on one of its popular Hot Bird satellites, on a more advanced satellite that is resistant to jamming. But that required Iranians to purchase new equipment, which is illegal and hard to find. \r\n\r\nWhile most in the opposition focused on the tactical battle with the government, some saw the struggle in broader terms. \r\n\r\n''''This is not about the opposition Green Movement in Iran now,'''' said Mr. Khoini, a visiting scholar at Stanford. ''''This is about democracy and the fact that when people have access to information, they can make wise choices. No one, even the current leaders of the opposition, can hijack the movement like the way the Islamists did in the 1979 revolution if people can have access to free information.''''\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: March 19, 2010\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\r\n\r\n\r\n', '');

Gen. Keith B. Alexander, wrote to members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that computer network warfare was evolving so rapidly that there was a ''''mismatch between our technical capabilities to conduct operations and the governing laws and policies.'''' \r\n\r\nAs he prepared for a confirmation hearing on Thursday as the first head of the Cyber Command, he pledged that the White House and Pentagon were ''''working hard to resolve the mismatch.''''\r\n\r\nIn a 32-page response to questions from senators, General Alexander sketched out the broad battlefield envisioned for the computer warfare command and acknowledged the kind of targets that his new headquarters could be ordered to attack. \r\n\r\nThe target list included traditional battlefield prizes -- command-and-control systems at military headquarters, air defense networks and weapons systems that require computers to operate. \r\n\r\nBut he agreed with a question submitted by the Senate that asked whether the target list would include civilian institutions and municipal infrastructure that are essential to state sovereignty and stability, including power grids, banks and financial networks, transportation and telecommunications.\r\n\r\nGeneral Alexander promised that the Cyber Command would be sensitive to the ripple effects from this kind of warfare, and would honor the laws of war that govern traditional combat in seeking to limit the impact on civilians.\r\n\r\n''''It is difficult for me to conceive of an instance where it would be appropriate to attack a bank or a financial institution, unless perhaps it was being used solely to support enemy military operations,'''' he wrote. General Alexander did not note it in his response, but the Bush administration considered exactly that kind of network attack on Iraq''s banking system before the invasion of 2003, but rejected the idea, fearing an unintended impact on global financial markets.\r\n\r\nThe confirmation hearing will be the public''s first opportunity to hear General Alexander describe the computer warfare command''s proposed objectives and responsibilities -- and what safeguards he will pledge to protect privacy in the United States and to respect the interests of allies and neutral nations.\r\n\r\nHe is the first chief of the Pentagon''s newest global combatant headquarters, and the first whose sole mission is cyberspace.\r\n\r\nIf confirmed, General Alexander would receive a fourth star and be the first career military intelligence officer to lead a global combatant command. He would, in military jargon, be dual-hatted, a term to describe his role in charge of the Cyber Command while continuing to lead the National Security Agency, which specializes in electronic intelligence, including phone and computer espionage. \r\n\r\nThe N.S.A.''s role in intercepting international calls to and from the United States since the Sept. 11 attacks, first approved by secret orders from President George W. Bush and largely continued by President Obama with the blessing of Congress, generated intense contention -- and scrutiny by Congress and the courts. Because the agency spies on the computer systems of foreign governments and terrorist groups, General Alexander would, in effect, be put in charge of both finding and, if need be, neutralizing cyberattacks in the making, as well as defending military computer networks.\r\n\r\n''''If confirmed, I will operate within applicable laws, policies and authorities,'''' General Alexander wrote to the senators. ''''I will also identify any gaps in doctrine, policy and law that may prevent national objectives from being fully realized or executed.''''\r\n\r\nThe military is moving into uncharted territory as it seeks to defend national interests and carry out offensive operations inside computer networks, he wrote, with nations of the world not even agreeing on what constitutes a computer attack or the appropriate response.\r\n\r\nHe wrote that there was no theory of deterrence to guide planning for cyberwarfare similar to strategies that guided nuclear planning in the cold war, and that it remained difficult to assess exactly who carried out an attack over computer networks.\r\n\r\nThe new Cyber Command was announced last year, and the unusually long delay in scheduling a confirmation hearing for its proposed leader is evidence of the intense behind-the-scenes debate over the command''s role, missions, authorities and safeguards.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge highlighted by General Alexander is the role that the military''s Cyber Command would play on American soil, since it has far greater capabilities than the Department of Homeland Security. By tradition and law, the military only operates within the United States if ordered by the president.

Keith B. Alexander, suggested that such a heavily restricted network would allow the government to impose greater protections for the nation''s vital, official on-line operations. General Alexander labeled the new network ''''a secure zone, a protected zone.'''' Others have nicknamed it ''''dot-secure.'''' \r\n\r\nIt would provide to essential networks like those that tie together the banking, aviation, and public utility systems the kind of protection that the military has built around secret military and diplomatic communications networks -- although even these are not completely invulnerable.\r\n\r\nFor years, experts have warned of the risks of Internet attacks on civilian networks. An article published a few months ago by the National Academy of Engineering said that ''''cyber systems are the ''weakest link'' in the electricity system,'''' and that ''''security must be designed into the system from the start, not glued on as an afterthought.''''\r\n\r\nGeneral Alexander, an Army officer who leads the military''s new Cyber Command, did not explain just where the fence should be built between the conventional Internet and his proposed secure zone, or how the gates would be opened to allow appropriate access to information they need every day. General Alexander said the White House hopes to complete a policy review on cyber issues in time for Congress to debate updated or new legislation when it convenes in January.\r\n\r\nGeneral Alexander''s new command is responsible for defending Defense Department computer networks and, if directed by the president, carrying out computer-network attacks overseas.\r\n\r\nBut the military is broadly prohibited from engaging in law enforcement operations on American soil without a presidential order, so the command''s potential role in assisting the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Department of Energy in the event of a major attack inside the United States has not been set down in law or policy.\r\n\r\n''''There is a real probability that in the future, this country will get hit with a destructive attack, and we need to be ready for it,'''' General Alexander said in a roundtable with reporters at the National Cryptologic Museum here at Fort Meade in advance of his Congressional testimony on Thursday morning.\r\n\r\n''''I believe this is one of the most critical problems our country faces,'''' he said. ''''We need to get that right. I think we have to have a discussion about roles and responsibilities: What''s the role of Cyber Command? What''s the role of the ''intel'' community? What''s the role of the rest of the Defense Department? What''s the role of D.H.S.? And how do you make that team work? That''s going to take time.''''\r\n\r\nSome critics have questioned whether the Defense Department can step up protection of vital computer networks without crashing against the public''s ability to live and work with confidence on the Internet. General Alexander said, ''''We can protect civil liberties and privacy and still do our mission. We''ve got to do that.''''\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the civilian networks that are at risk, he said: ''''If one of those destructive attacks comes right now, I''m focused on the Defense Department. What are the responsibilities -- and I think this is part of the discussion -- for the power grid, for financial networks, for other critical infrastructure? How do you protect the country when it comes to that kind of attack, and who is responsible for it?''''\r\n\r\nAs General Alexander prepared for his testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, the ranking Republican on the panel, Howard P. McKeon of California, noted the Pentagon''s progress in expanding its cyber capabilities.\r\n\r\nBut he said that ''''many questions remain as to how Cyber Command will meet such a broad mandate'''' given the clear ''''vulnerabilities in cyberspace.''''\r\n\r\nThe committee chairman, Rep. Ike Skelton, Democrat of Missouri, said that ''''cyberspace is an environment where distinctions and divisions between public and private, government and commercial, military and nonmilitary are blurred.'''' He said that it is important ''''that we engage in this discussion in a very direct way and include the public.''''\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: September 24, 2010\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\r\n\r\n\r\n', '');

SANGER; Ethan Bronner contributed reporting from Israel, and William J. Broad from New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLENGTH: 1534 words\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeep inside the computer worm that some specialists suspect is aimed at slowing Iran''s race for a nuclear weapon lies what could be a fleeting reference to the Book of Esther, the Old Testament tale in which the Jews pre-empt a Persian plot to destroy them.\r\n\r\nThat use of the word ''''Myrtus'''' -- which can be read as an allusion to Esther -- to name a file inside the code is one of several murky clues that have emerged as computer experts try to trace the origin and purpose of the rogue Stuxnet program, which seeks out a specific kind of command module for industrial equipment.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the Israelis are not saying whether Stuxnet has any connection to the secretive cyberwar unit it has built inside Israel''s intelligence service. Nor is the Obama administration, which while talking about cyberdefenses has also rapidly ramped up a broad covert program, inherited from the Bush administration, to undermine Iran''s nuclear program. In interviews in several countries, experts in both cyberwar and nuclear enrichment technology say the Stuxnet mystery may never be solved. \r\n\r\nThere are many competing explanations for myrtus, which could simply signify myrtle, a plant important to many cultures in the region. But some security experts see the reference as a signature allusion to Esther, a clear warning in a mounting technological and psychological battle as Israel and its allies try to breach Tehran''s most heavily guarded project. Others doubt the Israelis were involved and say the word could have been inserted as deliberate misinformation, to implicate Israel.\r\n\r\n''''The Iranians are already paranoid about the fact that some of their scientists have defected and several of their secret nuclear sites have been revealed,'''' one former intelligence official who still works on Iran issues said recently. ''''Whatever the origin and purpose of Stuxnet, it ramps up the psychological pressure.''''\r\n\r\nSo a calling card in the code could be part of a mind game, or sloppiness or whimsy from the coders.\r\n\r\nThe malicious code has appeared in many countries, notably China, India, Indonesia and Iran. But there are tantalizing hints that Iran''s nuclear program was the primary target. Officials in both the United States and Israel have made no secret of the fact that undermining the computer systems that control Iran''s huge enrichment plant at Natanz is a high priority. (The Iranians know it, too: They have never let international inspectors into the control room of the plant, the inspectors report, presumably to keep secret what kind of equipment they are using.)\r\n\r\nThe fact that Stuxnet appears designed to attack a certain type of Siemens industrial control computer, used widely to manage oil pipelines, electrical power grids and many kinds of nuclear plants, may be telling. Just last year officials in Dubai seized a large shipment of those controllers -- known as the Simatic S-7 -- after Western intelligence agencies warned that the shipment was bound for Iran and would likely be used in its nuclear program.\r\n\r\n''''What we were told by many sources,'''' said Olli Heinonen, who retired last month as the head of inspections at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, ''''was that the Iranian nuclear program was acquiring this kind of equipment.''''\r\n\r\nAlso, starting in the summer of 2009, the Iranians began having tremendous difficulty running their centrifuges, the tall, silvery machines that spin at supersonic speed to enrich uranium -- and which can explode spectacularly if they become unstable. In New York last week, Iran''s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, shrugged off suggestions that the country was having trouble keeping its enrichment plants going.\r\n\r\nYet something -- perhaps the worm or some other form of sabotage, bad parts or a dearth of skilled technicians -- is indeed slowing Iran''s advance.\r\n\r\nThe reports on Iran show a fairly steady drop in the number of centrifuges used to enrich uranium at the main Natanz plant. After reaching a peak of 4,920 machines in May 2009, the numbers declined to 3,772 centrifuges this past August, the most recent reporting period. That is a decline of 23 percent. (At the same time, production of low-enriched uranium has remained fairly constant, indicating the Iranians have learned how to make better use of fewer working machines.)\r\n\r\nComputer experts say the first versions of the worm appeared as early as 2009 and that the sophisticated version contained an internal time stamp from January of this year.\r\n\r\nThese events add up to a mass of suspicions, not proof. Moreover, the difficulty experts have had in figuring out the origin of Stuxnet points to both the appeal and the danger of computer attacks in a new age of cyberwar.\r\n\r\nFor intelligence agencies they are an almost irresistible weapon, free of fingerprints. Israel has poured huge resources into Unit 8200, its secretive cyberwar operation, and the United States has built its capacity inside the National Security Agency and inside the military, which just opened a Cyber Command.\r\n\r\nBut the near impossibility of figuring out where they came from makes deterrence a huge problem -- and explains why many have warned against the use of cyberweapons. No country, President Obama was warned even before he took office, is more vulnerable to cyberattack than the United States.\r\n\r\nFor now, it is hard to determine if the worm has infected centrifuge controllers at Natanz. While the S-7 industrial controller is used widely in Iran, and many other countries, even Siemens says it does not know where it is being used. Alexander Machowetz, a spokesman in Germany for Siemens, said the company did no business with Iran''s nuclear program. ''''It could be that there is equipment,'''' he said in a telephone interview. ''''But we never delivered it to Natanz.''''\r\n\r\nBut Siemens industrial controllers are unregulated commodities that are sold and resold all over the world -- the controllers intercepted in Dubai traveled through China, according to officials familiar with the seizure.\r\n\r\nRalph Langner, a German computer security consultant who was the first independent expert to assert that the malware had been ''''weaponized'''' and designed to attack the Iranian centrifuge array, argues that the Stuxnet worm could have been brought into the Iranian nuclear complex by Russian contractors.\r\n\r\n''''It would be an absolute no-brainer to leave an infected USB stick near one of these guys,'''' he said, ''''and there would be more than a 50 percent chance of having him pick it up and infect his computer.''''\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons to suspect Israel''s involvement in Stuxnet. Intelligence is the single largest section of its military and the unit devoted to signal, electronic and computer network intelligence, known as Unit 8200, is the largest group within intelligence.\r\n\r\nYossi Melman, who covers intelligence for the newspaper Haaretz and is at work on a book about Israeli intelligence over the past decade, said in a telephone interview that he suspected that Israel was involved.\r\n\r\nHe noted that Meir Dagan, head of Mossad, had his term extended last year partly because he was said to be involved in important projects. He added that in the past year Israeli estimates of when Iran will have a nuclear weapon had been extended to 2014.\r\n\r\n''''They seem to know something, that they have more time than originally thought,'''' he said.\r\n\r\nThen there is the allusion to myrtus -- which may be telling, or may be a red herring.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the teams of computer security researchers who have been dissecting the software found a text string that suggests that the attackers named their project Myrtus. The guava fruit is part of the Myrtus family, and one of the code modules is identified as Guava.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Langner who first noted that Myrtus is an allusion to the Hebrew word for Esther. The Book of Esther tells the story of a Persian plot against the Jews, who attacked their enemies pre-emptively.\r\n\r\n''''If you read the Bible you can make a guess,'''' said Mr. Langner, in a telephone interview from Germany on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nCarol Newsom, an Old Testament scholar at Emory University, confirmed the linguistic connection between the plant family and the Old Testament figure, noting that Queen Esther''s original name in Hebrew was Hadassah, which is similar to the Hebrew word for myrtle. Perhaps, she said, ''''someone was making a learned cross-linguistic wordplay.''''\r\n\r\nBut other Israeli experts said they doubted Israel''s involvement. Shai Blitzblau, the technical director and head of the computer warfare laboratory at Maglan, an Israeli company specializing in information security, said he was ''''convinced that Israel had nothing to do with Stuxnet.''''\r\n\r\n''''We did a complete simulation of it and we sliced the code to its deepest level,'''' he said. ''''We have studied its protocols and functionality. Our two main suspects for this are high-level industrial espionage against Siemens and a kind of academic experiment.''''\r\n\r\nMr. Blitzblau noted that the worm hit India, Indonesia and Russia before it hit Iran, though the worm has been found disproportionately in Iranian computers. He also noted that the Stuxnet worm has no code that reports back the results of the infection it creates. Presumably, a good intelligence agency would like to trace its work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: September 30, 2010\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: CHART: A Possible Target: The Stuxnet worm, which targets a type of Siemens computer suspected to be in use at Iran''s uranium enrichment plant at Natanz, might be responsible for a decline in operating centrifuges since early 2009.

Then, last month, a German security researcher suggested that the program''s real target might be the Iranian nuclear program -- and that clues in the coding suggested that Israel was the creator. Since then, there has been growing alarm about the worm, as its target and sophistication have become more apparent. The code has appeared in many countries, notably China, India, Indonesia and Iran. It appears designed to attack a certain type of Siemens industrial control computer, used widely to manage oil pipelines, electrical power grids and many kinds of nuclear plants. The question is: Just how dangerous has this worm and cyberwarfare become?\r\n\r\nHow widespread is cyberwarfare? \r\n\r\nA 2007 F.B.I. report asserted that 108 countries had at least some offensive cyberwarfare capabilities. And there has been widespread speculation that a secret cyberwar ''''arms race'''' is under way as a number of countries build sophisticated software and hardware attack capabilities. Most recent wars and military engagements, like Russia''s quarrel with Estonia in 2007 or with Georgia in 2008, have been accompanied by a ''''cyberwar'''' engagement, in which government and financial Web sites have been targeted.\r\n\r\nWhat was the earliest case of cyberwarfare?\r\n\r\nIn his book ''''At the Abyss,'''' Thomas C. Reed, a former secretary of the Air Force, described a software program known as a Trojan horse, in which industrial control software was covertly added by the United States to equipment being shipped to the Soviet Union from Canada. When the equipment was installed in a trans-Siberian gas pipeline in June 1982, it suddenly went haywire, touching off a huge explosion and fire, according to Mr. Reed.\r\n\r\nAnother episode in January 1990, the collapse of AT&T''s long-distance network, also raised suspicions of sabotage.\r\n\r\nBut security experts have been concerned about potential cyberattacks since the 1970s, during the early days of the Arpanet, an experimental, military-financed research network that was the predecessor to the Internet. There was great concern about a network connection -- a now old-fashioned 9600 baud modem -- that had been installed by scientific researchers linking Moscow and the United States, via a mathematics research center in Vienna. When national security officials discovered the link, financing to the center was canceled.\r\n\r\nHow is Stuxnet different?\r\n\r\nStuxnet is the first widely analyzed malware program that is intended to jump from Windows-based computers to a specialized system used for controlling industrial equipment, like electric power grids, manufacturing plants, gas pipelines, dams and power plants. Previously, most high-profile cyberattacks have focused on Web sites and corporate or military networks.\r\n\r\nAt least, that''s true when it comes to proven cyberattacks. But there has also been speculation about episodes that could have been caused by sabotage. For example, The Los Angeles Times reported in 2001 that intrusions into the network that controlled the electrical grid were traced to someone in Guangdong Province, China. Later reports of other electric grid attacks have often included allegations that the break-ins were orchestrated by the Chinese, although no proof has been produced.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Stuxnet, what are arguments for and against Israel''s involvement?\r\n\r\nRalph Langner, a German security researcher, was the first to point out that it appeared that the Stuxnet program had been tailored to attack a nuclear facility or a uranium enrichment plant. And several hints in the code suggest Israeli authorship, including a possible allusion to the Book of Esther, which describes Jewish retaliation against a Persian threat, and a number -- 19790509 -- that appears to refer to the date of the execution of an Iranian Jew by a firing squad in Tehran.\r\n\r\nBut many military and intelligence analysts, including several with direct knowledge of Israeli intelligence operations, have said it is unlikely that either an Israeli or United States operation would leave such blatant clues. That leaves the possibility that someone wanted to plant evidence pointing incorrectly to Israeli involvement. Most computer security specialists say the authorship of the program may never be discovered.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of attack do computer security experts fear most?\r\n\r\nThere has been widespread fear about attacks that jam or damage large financial networks, the electric power grid, power plants, transportation systems or any of the modern infrastructure underlying industrial economies.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, the first step in securing these systems has been to insure that they are entirely separated from the Internet. However, even if they are separated from the Internet, in many cases they use internal networks based on the Internet protocol, as well as common computing equipment, like Microsoft and Intel-based computers. That means they remain potentially vulnerable to a ''''sneakernet'''' attack, in which a malicious program is physically carried into an isolated network either accidentally or by an intruder.\r\n\r\nCan this kind of attack be done by a lone hacker?\r\n\r\nIn the case of Stuxnet, computer security specialists generally agree that it was not the work of one person but rather a team of sophisticated programmers. Many who have examined the malicious code have stated that it would have required an organization with substantial financial resources to develop, test and then release such a program. Certainly nations with cyberwar capabilities are potential suspects, but they are not the only possible creators. China, Israel and the Palestinians are all known to have irregular cyberarmies of motivated hackers with significant skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: October 3, 2010\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: DRAWING (DRAWING BY ERIN SCHELL) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\r\n\r\n\r\n', '');

A presidential order dispatches the military forces, working under the control of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. \r\n\r\nUnder the new rules, the president would approve the use of the military''s expertise in computer-network warfare, and the Department of Homeland Security would direct the work.\r\n\r\nOfficials involved in drafting the rules said the goal was to ensure a rapid response to a cyberthreat while balancing concerns that civil liberties might be at risk should the military take over such domestic operations.\r\n\r\nThe rules were deemed essential because most of the government''s computer-network capabilities reside within the Pentagon -- while most of the important targets are on domestic soil, whether within the government or in critical private operations like financial networks or a regional power grid.\r\n\r\nThe new approach will begin with a Department of Homeland Security team deploying to Fort Meade, Md., home to both the National Security Agency, which specializes in electronic espionage, and the military''s new Cyber Command. In exchange, a team of military networking experts would be assigned to the operations center at the Homeland Security Department.\r\n\r\nThe rules were detailed in a memorandum of agreement signed in late September by Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, but they were not released until last week.\r\n\r\nRobert J. Butler, the Pentagon''s deputy assistant secretary for cyber policy, said the memorandum was intended to cut through legal debates about the authority for operating domestically, and to focus on how best to respond to the threat of attack on critical computer networks.\r\n\r\nMr. Butler said teams of lawyers would watch for potential violations of civil liberties. ''''We have put protection measures in place,'''' he said.\r\n\r\nThe Pentagon is expected to release a full National Defense Strategy for Cyber Operations this year, to be followed by broader interagency guidance from the White House, perhaps in the form of a presidential directive, in 2011.\r\n\r\nCongress also is weighing legislation that would update domestic law to deal with advances in computer-based surveillance and cyberwarfare.\r\n\r\nWilliam J. Lynn III, the deputy defense secretary, underscored the Pentagon''s ''''need to protect our military networks,'''' but said that ''''it''s a national challenge as well.'''' In an interview with Charlie Rose broadcast Monday by PBS, Mr. Lynn added: ''''We need to protect our critical infrastructure. We need to protect our intellectual property. And that''s a whole-of-government effort.''''\r\n\r\nDuring a visit last week to NATO headquarters in Brussels, Mr. Gates lobbied for new partnerships to combat computer threats, while warning that the NATO networks were vulnerable.\r\n\r\n''''On cybersecurity, the alliance is far behind,'''' Mr. Gates said. ''''Our vulnerabilities are well known, but our existing programs to remedy these weaknesses are inadequate.''''\r\n\r\nMr. Gates said he was not concerned that secret intelligence shared with allies would be compromised, but he said NATO had weaknesses in its defenses for computer networks at its headquarters and throughout the shared command structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: October 21, 2010\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\r\n\r\n\r\n', '');

Cartwright, the vice chairman; Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the Army chief; and Adm. Gary Roughead, the chief of naval operations.\r\nAndrew J. Bacevich, a retired Army officer who is a professor of history and international relations at Boston University, said this round of replacements, coming after two years of difficult and sometimes intense wrangling over how to carry on the war in Afghanistan, ''''is particularly important, and is likely to prove particularly difficult.''''\r\n''''The challenge facing the president,'''' Mr. Bacevich said, ''''will be to identify leaders who will provide him with disinterested advice, informed by a concern for the national interest, and, in doing so, to avoid either the appearance or the reality of politicizing the senior leadership.''''\r\nAt the top of the new pantheon of military power, the president needs a heavyweight to succeed Mr. Gates, an unexpected holdover from the Bush administration who stayed longer than many expected to become perhaps the most influential member of the Obama cabinet.\r\nWhite House officials say the president is not prepared to announce any decisions on his new slate of Pentagon and military leaders for next year.\r\nBut speculation for the top Pentagon job in recent days has included two respected veterans on military matters, both with bipartisan credentials and hands-on experience: John J. Hamre, a deputy defense secretary in the Clinton administration who now leads the Center for Strategic and International Studies while running the Defense Policy Board, an advisory panel to Mr. Gates; and Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, who lost his seat last week and with it the chairmanship of the House Armed Services Committee.\r\nAnother name certain to be on Mr. Obama''s list is Michele A. Flournoy, currently the Pentagon''s under secretary for policy and one of the foremost national security specialists of the up-and-coming generation. Her appointment would allow Mr. Obama to claim another first in naming a woman to become defense secretary, something he could also accomplish by moving Hillary Rodham Clinton into the job from secretary of state.\r\nOther possible candidates include Ray Mabus, the Navy secretary who formerly served as governor of Mississippi and ambassador to Saudi Arabia; Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, an Army veteran; and Richard J. Danzig, a former Navy secretary.\r\nIt also is tricky to pick members of the Joint Chiefs, who are not only the president''s senior military advisers on questions of war but also the leaders of the individual military services, at the fulcrum of competing missions and constituencies that are never easy to balance.\r\nA thorough revamping of the high command is especially complex at a time of persistent challenges on so many fronts, like the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the threats from Iran and North Korea and the challenges from Russia and China, all while facing the constant risk of a terrorist attack.\r\nThe new military leadership, after years of war and economic crisis, also has to cope with strains on military budgets, while caring for the health and morale of a force that simultaneously must be modernized.\r\nThere are lingering strains between top civilian aides to Mr. Obama and the military brass, over issues as diverse as how to fight and wind down the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and how to allow military service by openly gay troops.\r\nAny commander in chief is theoretically free to replace his top civilian and military subordinates whenever he chooses, but it rarely happens all at once.\r\nTraditionally, a new president appoints a new defense secretary and allows the chiefs to serve out their tours, which tend to fall more or less randomly across a president''s term in office. Mr. Obama was the first to carry over a defense secretary who had served a president of a different party, and Mr. Gates''s expected departure now falls coincidentally along with four members of the six-person Joint Chiefs. (The Marines got a new commandant, Gen. James F. Amos, last month, and the Air Force chief, Gen. Norton A. Schwartz, retires in 2012 unless he is rotated into another senior position, which is possible.)\r\nThe changes in 2011 are so unusual, and the national security risks today so significant, that General Cartwright, the vice chairman, offered to retire a year early, so that a new officer would be in place for some continuity, according to Pentagon and administration officials familiar with the discussions.\r\nBut General Cartwright -- known for his fluency in nuts-and-bolts issues like missile defense, cyberwarfare and procurement -- has been described as one of the president''s favorite officers, and was asked to stay on. He is very likely on the list of those who would be considered for promotion to chairman.\r\nWhen Mr. Obama had opportunities in recent weeks to replace top members of his White House inner circle, including his chief of staff and his national security adviser, he opted to replace his inaugural ''''team of rivals,'''' populated by outsiders, by promoting trusted confidants and moving toward creating, in essence, a team of insiders.\r\nSo the questions before Mr. Obama include trust and comfort and assurances that his policy decisions will be executed the way he wants.\r\nThe expected candidates are all familiar to the White House, and all those on any list of suitable officers have blue-chip resumes but differing temperaments.\r\nOne of the first questions the president will have to answer for himself is what to do with Gen. David H. Petraeus, the former Iraq commander asked to rush to Afghanistan when Mr. Obama relieved two commanders there in a row.\r\nSupporters say that General Petraeus has earned the chairman''s job by reason of experience, intellect and sacrifice, but that may not satisfy some political advisers around the president, who still resent the officers involved in the Afghanistan-Pakistan review last year. General Petraeus also could remain longer in Afghanistan or could be offered the job of Army chief or that of supreme allied commander in Europe, a post once held by Dwight D. Eisenhower and so hardly a dead end.\r\nIn addition to Generals Cartwright and Petraeus, another potential candidate for chairman is Adm. James G. Stavridis, currently the NATO commander and one of the Navy''s most intellectual officers; he likewise could be slotted into the job of chief of naval operations.\r\nThree other highly regarded Army officers remain in the hunt for any of the top jobs. They include Gen. Ray Odierno, a three-time Iraq commander now in charge of the military''s Joint Forces Command; Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, who had two tours in Iraq before serving as acting commander of American forces in the Middle East and who now oversees Army training and doctrine; and Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, a two-time Iraq commander who is the Army''s vice chief of staff, with a focus on improving care for wounded soldiers.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: November 8, 2010\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: PHOTO: President Obama will replace Defense Secretary Robert M.

Turkey also wanted money to buy antimissile components.\r\nMissile defense has long created tensions between NATO and Russia, but American officials were optimistic that the meeting on Saturday would prove more productive than earlier ones with the Russian president at the time, Vladimir V. Putin, who made no secret of his mistrust of the alliance.\r\nIn general, senior NATO officials note a welcoming Russian tone under President Dmitri A. Medvedev to the idea of cooperation with NATO on missile defense and European security, and they also note the general silence of Mr. Putin, now prime minister.\r\nOn Saturday, Russia will be formally invited to take part in the missile defense system, especially with intelligence and radar sharing. Moscow has indicated that it is interested but has questions, and wants to ensure that the system is not aimed at countering Russian missiles.\r\nThe missile defense system approved Friday is different from the fixed-missile defense that President George W. Bush initiated and that proved controversial. The idea is to have a phased system of radars and antimissile missiles that would be less expensive than the Bush system. The NATO spokesman, James Appathurai, said the nearly $1.5 billion cost could be managed over 10 years.\r\nAmerican officials hailed the agreements as a victory for Mr. Obama and his efforts to strengthen the alliance and improve relations with Moscow. They said the agreements showed that Mr. Obama retained influence and credibility among the allies despite his party''s drubbing in the recent midterm elections and his inability so far to overcome Senate Republican objections to a revised nuclear arms treaty with Russia.\r\nMr. Obama has been seeking support among the allies here for the treaty, known as New Start, both to reassure Senate Republicans and to increase pressure on them.\r\nThe snag for the treaty clouds the broader efforts to ''''reset'''' relations with the Kremlin. Russian officials have said that they understand the domestic political situation, but that a failure to ratify the treaty would have some impact, at least, on the warmth of future relations.\r\nThe White House distributed remarks by Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the secretary general of NATO, supporting ratification of the treaty. Mrs. Merkel said no one was so naive as to believe immediately in a world without nuclear weapons. The White House distributed a column by the Polish foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, who wrote that ''''the senators'' decision will inevitably have an impact beyond their country''s borders. It will be particularly significant for Poland, a staunch ally.''''\r\nMr. Obama told American reporters, ''''Just as this is a national security priority for the United States, the message that I''ve received since I arrived from my fellow leaders here at NATO could not be clearer: New Start will strengthen our alliance, and it will strengthen European security.''''\r\nThe NATO leaders also signed off on a broad new strategic doctrine, the first since 1999, intended to explain to their citizens why the alliance still matters after the cold war. The accord ends weeks of negotiations among the 28-member alliance over how to deal with Russia and to decide what role disarmament and nuclear weapons will play in the alliance.\r\nMr. Rasmussen said the strategic concept, a sort of mission statement, meant that NATO would ''''continue to play its unique and essential role in ensuring our common defense and security.''''\r\nThe document is an effort to define the broader threats to NATO and its populations, which now include terrorism, cyberwarfare and failed states, while reconfirming the idea of collective defense. It promises to work to ''''prevent crises, manage conflicts and stabilize postconflict situations,'''' and pledges closer cooperation with the United Nations and the European Union.\r\nThe document also commits the alliance, for the first time, ''''to the goal of creating the conditions for a world without nuclear weapons,'''' while reconfirming the centrality of nuclear deterrence ''''as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world.''''\r\nSaturday will mark the beginning of NATO''s own reset with Russia. Although some countries, particularly the Baltic states, are skeptical about warming relations between NATO and Russia, Mr. Rasmussen said the alliance and Russia shared many common threats, like terrorism and drug trafficking.\r\nMr. Medvedev was invited to the NATO summit meeting Friday night, a major change from two years ago, when Mr. Putin crashed the NATO dinner in Bucharest, Romania, to lecture Mr. Bush about the dangers of NATO expansion to Georgia and Ukraine.\r\nRussian and Georgia fought a small war later that year, and Russian troops still occupy two provinces of Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. NATO officials contend that a closer relationship with Moscow is the best way to make progress on Georgia.\r\nBut Mr. Obama made a point on Friday of meeting the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, to show American support for Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\nOn Afghanistan, there is general agreement that NATO will begin next year to hand over responsibility for security to the Afghan government and its troops and police officers, a process that is supposed to be finished by the end of 2014. European nations that have troops in Afghanistan are eager to shift to noncombat roles, so there will be much discussion down the line about which provinces are handed over first.\r\nWhile the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, has annoyed American and European officials with criticism of American military tactics there, he met on Friday for an hour with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in a discussion American officials called ''''candid and friendly.'''' The Americans and other NATO allies are hopeful that Mr. Karzai will be careful in his comments here.\r\nMr. Obama told the Spanish daily newspaper El Pais that he expected the allies to pledge additional trainers for Afghan security forces. ''''This effort is going to take time, and our commitment to Afghanistan and the Afghan people is for the long-term,'''' he said. ''''We cannot turn our backs on the Afghan people.''''\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: November 20, 2010\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Take your places please: President Obama and leaders of other countries gathered for the official NATO group portrait at a summit meeting in Lisbon.\r\nA sealed trash container along Mr. Obama''s motorcade route was among the precautions taken for the NATO meeting.

BURNS and RAVI SOMAIYA; John Markoff and Ashlee Vance contributed reporting from San Francisco.\r\n\r\nSECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1\r\n\r\nLENGTH: 1095 words\r\n\r\nLONDON -- In a campaign that had some declaring the start of a ''''cyberwar,'''' hundreds of Internet activists mounted retaliatory attacks on Wednesday on the Web sites of multinational companies and other organizations they deemed hostile to the WikiLeaks antisecrecy organization and its jailed founder, Julian Assange.\r\nWithin 12 hours of a British judge''s decision on Tuesday to deny Mr. Assange bail in a Swedish extradition case, attacks on the Web sites of WikiLeaks''s ''''enemies,'''' as defined by the organization''s impassioned supporters around the world, caused several corporate Web sites to become inaccessible or slow down markedly.\r\nTargets of the attacks, in which activists overwhelmed the sites with traffic, included the Web site of MasterCard, which had stopped processing donations for WikiLeaks; Amazon.com, which revoked the use of its computer servers; and PayPal, which stopped accepting donations for Mr. Assange''s group. Visa.com was also affected by the attacks, as were the Web sites of the Swedish prosecutor''s office and the lawyer representing the two women whose allegations of sexual misconduct are the basis of Sweden''s extradition bid.\r\nThe Internet assaults underlined the growing reach of self-described ''''cyberanarchists,'''' antigovernment and anticorporate activists who have made an icon of Mr. Assange, a 39-year-old Australian.\r\nThe speed and range of the attacks also appeared to show the resilience of the backing among computer activists for Mr. Assange, who has appeared increasingly isolated in recent months amid the furor stoked by WikiLeaks''s Web site posting of hundreds of thousands of secret Pentagon documents on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\r\nMr. Assange has come under renewed attack in the past two weeks for posting the first tranche of a trove of 250,000 secret State Department cables that have exposed American diplomats'' frank assessments of relations with many countries, forcing Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to express regret to world leaders and raising fears that they and other sources would become more reticent.\r\nThe New York Times and four other news organizations last week began publishing articles based on the archive of cables made available to them.\r\nIn recent months, some of Mr. Assange''s closest associates in WikiLeaks abandoned him, calling him autocratic and capricious and accusing him of reneging on WikiLeaks''s original pledge of impartiality to launch a concerted attack on the United States. He has been simultaneously fighting a remote battle with the Swedish prosecutors, who have sought his extradition for questioning on accusations of ''''rape, sexual molestation and forceful coercion'''' made by the Swedish women. Mr. Assange has denied any wrongdoing in the cases.\r\nAmerican officials have repeatedly said that they are reviewing possible criminal charges against Mr. Assange, a step that could lead to a bid to extradite him to the United States and confront him with having to fight for his freedom on two fronts.\r\nThe cyberattacks in Mr. Assange''s defense appear to have been coordinated by Anonymous, a loosely affiliated group of activist computer hackers who have singled out other groups before, including the Church of Scientology. Last weekend, members of Anonymous vowed in two online manifestos to take revenge on any organization that lined up against WikiLeaks.\r\nAnonymous claimed responsibility for the MasterCard attack in Web messages and, according to one activist associated with the group, conducted waves of attacks on other companies during the day. The group said the actions were part of an effort called Operation Payback, which began as a way of punishing companies that attempted to stop Internet file-sharing and movie downloads.\r\nThe activist, Gregg Housh, who disavows a personal role in any illegal online activity, said that 1,500 supporters had been in online forums and chat rooms organizing the mass ''''denial of service'''' attacks. His account was confirmed by Jose Nazario, a senior security researcher at Arbor Networks, a Chelmsford, Mass., firm that tracks malicious activity on computer networks.\r\nMost of the corporations whose sites were targeted did not explain why they severed ties with WikiLeaks. But PayPal issued statements saying its decision was based on ''''a violation'''' of its policy on promoting illegal activities.\r\nAlmost all the corporate Web sites that were attacked appeared to be operating normally later on Wednesday, suggesting that any economic impact was limited. But the sense of an Internet war was reinforced when Netcraft, a British Internet monitoring firm, reported that the Web site being used by the hackers to distribute denial-of-service software had been suspended by a Dutch hosting firm, Leaseweb.\r\nA sense of the belligerent mood among activists was given when one contributor to a forum the group uses, WhyWeProtest.net, wrote of the attacks: ''''The war is on. And everyone ought to spend some time thinking about it, discussing it with others, preparing yourselves so you know how to act if something compels you to make a decision. Be very careful not to err on the side of inaction.''''\r\nMr. Housh acknowledged that there had been online talk among the hackers of a possible Internet campaign against the two women who have been Mr. Assange''s accusers in the Swedish case, but he said that ''''a lot of people don''t want to be involved.''''\r\nA Web search showed new blog posts in recent days in which the two women, identified by the Swedish prosecutors only as Ms. A. and Ms. W., were named, but it was not clear whether there was any link to Anonymous. The women have said that consensual sexual encounters with Mr. Assange became nonconsensual when condoms were no longer in use.\r\nThe cyberattacks on corporations Wednesday were seen by many supporters as a counterstrike against the United States. Mr. Assange''s online supporters have widely condemned the Obama administration as the unseen hand coordinating efforts to choke off WikiLeaks by denying it financing and suppressing its network of computer servers.\r\nMr. Housh described Mr. Assange in an interview as ''''a political prisoner,'''' a common view among WikiLeaks supporters who have joined Mr. Assange in condemning the sexual abuse accusations as part of an American-inspired ''''smear campaign.''''\r\nAnother activist used the analogy of the civil rights struggle for the cyberattacks.\r\n''''Are they disrupting business?'''' a contributor using the name Moryath wrote in a comment on the slashdot.org technology Web site. ''''Perhaps, but no worse than the lunch counter sit-ins did.''''\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: December 9, 2010\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper', 'robbie');

Gates had set low expectations for his three-day trip, likely his last visit to Beijing as defense secretary, which he undertook after President Obama and President Hu Jintao of China ordered their militaries to begin working out their differences ahead of Mr. Hu''s visit next week to the White House. The first meeting here bore out that caution, as well as predictions by Pentagon officials that the visit would be difficult and provide no breakthroughs.\r\nBut it did provide a clear reflection of the Chinese military''s growing confidence in its dealings with the United States.\r\nRegarding American concerns over China''s new weaponry, including a radar-evading jet fighter and an antiship ballistic missile potentially capable of hitting an American aircraft carrier, the Chinese defense minister, Gen. Liang Guanglie, suggested that the United States was overreacting to an effort to modernize.\r\n''''We can by no means call ourselves an advanced military force,'''' General Liang said at a joint news conference with Mr. Gates at the Chinese Ministry of Defense after a welcoming ceremony of goose-stepping Chinese troops. ''''The gap between us and that of advanced countries is at least two to three decades.'''' He added that China was interested only in its security and that ''''there are some people always in the world who want to label China''s military development a so-called threat to the world.''''\r\nOn Taiwan, the general implied that any further sale of arms would disrupt relations and prompt China to cut off military ties with Washington, as it has repeatedly in the past.\r\n''''We do not want to see that happen again,'''' General Liang said. He concluded, ''''Neither do we hope that the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan will again and further disrupt the development of our bilateral and military-to-military relationship.''''\r\nMr. Gates and General Liang did announce minor developments, among them a commitment to talk about future talks and the visit to Washington by the chief of the People''s Liberation Army''s general staff sometime in the first half of this year. But the American request for a specific date was frustrated.\r\nGeneral Liang responded to Mr. Gates''s proposal for an ''''in-depth strategic dialogue'''' between the United States and China on nuclear missile defense, space and cyberwarfare only by saying ''''we are studying it.''''\r\nStill, Mr. Gates took a positive tone on the contacts with the Chinese military, the People''s Liberation Army. ''''I come away from these meetings convinced that the P.L.A. leadership is as committed to fulfilling the mandate of our two presidents as I am,'''' he said at the news conference.\r\nChina''s military has grown increasingly forceful with the country''s political leadership, a fact Mr. Gates acknowledged obliquely to reporters en route to Beijing. Asked if he thought China''s political leaders were pressing for improved military relations with the United States even though the Chinese military did not necessarily want them, Mr. Gates replied, ''''I don''t know the answer to that question.''''\r\nAmerican military officials say there is a growing danger of a confrontation between American and Chinese forces in the Pacific Ocean, where Chinese ships have begun to challenge the United States Navy. China''s next generation of antiship missiles, American officials say, could force the United States to keep its warships a long way from Chinese shores, and from Taiwan. Ultimately, they say, the new technologies could give China an ability to operate hundreds of miles beyond its shores with a freedom it has never before enjoyed.\r\nLater on Monday, Mr. Gates met at the Great Hall with Vice President Xi Jinping, the heir apparent to Mr. Hu. ''''I believe the two sides should jointly and earnestly implement the consensus of our heads of state and make sure that our bilateral relations progress on the right track,'''' Mr. Xi said, shortly before reporters were pushed out of the room while Mr. Gates was speaking.\r\nBeyond a commitment to continue talking, the meeting between Mr. Gates and General Liang on Monday appeared to produce little of substance, said Huang Jing, a visiting professor and expert on China''s military and leadership at the National University of Singapore.\r\n''''The Chinese are playing tai chi with the Americans,'''' Dr. Huang said, referring to the Chinese martial art of self-defense. ''''Gates is going out; there are a lot of uncertainties about the Obama administration, its policy and the likelihood that there is going to be a second term. They want to wait until the dust settles down in Washington.''''\r\nNor, Dr. Huang said, is the relationship likely to change much in the near future. China''s military sees Beijing as a rising power and Washington as a declining one, he said, and so it has little incentive to accede to the Pentagon''s requests for more transparency and a more responsible approach toward regional peace and security.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: January 11, 2011\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: PHOTO: Gen.

SANGER and THOM SHANKER\r\n\r\nSECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1\r\n\r\nLENGTH: 1193 words\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON -- When President Obama assembled his first national security team, it was quickly dubbed, not always accurately, the ''''Team of Rivals.'''' Now that some of its key members are heading for the exits, the question is whether his next war council could be named the ''''Corps of Consensus.''''\r\nThe departure this summer of Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, arguably the most powerful voice in the cabinet, leaves more than an empty seat in the Situation Room. It is a chance for President Obama, at a critical moment in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and amid the Arab uprisings, to rethink the dynamic of the group making some of the most critical decisions in his presidency.\r\nNot long after Mr. Gates settles into his house in Washington State, the term will expire for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, who, like the defense secretary, was appointed by President George W. Bush. And a week ago, Deputy Secretary of State James B. Steinberg announced that he was leaving for an academic job -- removing one of the crucial players in Mr. Obama''s efforts to manage China''s rise.\r\nBut Mr. Gates''s role is the most critical. He often allied with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton -- who has said that she intends to leave the administration when this term ends -- including persuading Mr. Obama to launch the military buildup in Afghanistan in 2009. Together they won many other battles, but they visibly split last month on the military intervention in Libya.\r\nIn filling Mr. Gates''s chair, Mr. Obama will have to choose among a close new partner for Mrs. Clinton, a budget cutter, someone willing to take on the military or perhaps a dissenter who might challenge the course that is already set.\r\nWhite House officials, not surprisingly, will not say. But they acknowledge that Mr. Gates, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency who first worked in the White House when Mr. Obama was in junior high school, is an unusual figure. Outsiders say that finding someone who replicates each of Mr. Gates''s strengths -- or his willingness to disagree with the emerging policy on Libya, as he did in private discussions before Mr. Obama''s final decision will be next to impossible.\r\n''''Gates has played a unique role,'''' said Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser under the first President George Bush and a close friend of the secretary of defense. ''''And it will be very hard to replace him, not only for his stewardship at defense, but for the balanced approach he was able to bring to the foreign policy debates, the fact that he is a Republican and the fact that he worked so closely with Hillary.''''\r\nFrom the White House to the Pentagon, names of leading candidates are emerging, but it is unclear if any have deep support in the Oval Office.\r\nThe front-runner is clearly the C.I.A. director, Leon E. Panetta, which could open his job for Gen. David H. Petraeus, now the commander in Afghanistan. (An argument for appointing the general, who has had a sometimes strained relationship with the president, is that it could occupy a potential outside critic with an important government job.)\r\nAn oft-discussed alternative would be moving Ray Mabus, now the secretary of the Navy, to Mr. Gates''s job; his unusual resume ranges from the Gulf of Mexico to the Persian Gulf. (He was governor of Mississippi and ambassador to Saudi Arabia.)\r\nA more mainstream choice would be John J. Hamre, who was deputy defense secretary under President Bill Clinton, or even Colin L. Powell or Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat and a former Army paratrooper.\r\nAnd there is also discussion about whether Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs and one of President Obama''s favorite strategists, might be promoted to chairman despite concerns among fellow senior officers about his command and decision-making style.\r\nThe ''''Team of Rivals'''' notion emerged early in Mr. Obama''s search for a national security team, a reference to the cabinet that Lincoln assembled at the opening of the Civil War. Because Mrs. Clinton competed with Mr. Obama for the Democratic nomination for president, the phrase had an instant appeal, but it was never a precise fit.\r\nThere were clear camps of top advisers during the 2009 Afghanistan debate, when Mr. Gates, Admiral Mullen, General Petraeus and Mrs. Clinton lined up against Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Rahm Emanuel, then the chief of staff; and others who advocated a much smaller buildup, focused on counterterrorism.\r\nWith a staged troop withdrawal beginning this summer, it will be up to those who succeed Mr. Gates and Admiral Mullen to manage that process, while dealing with an officers corps that is trying to slow the pace.\r\nAt the State Department, Mrs. Clinton oversees the civilian side of the Afghan conflict and the difficult case of Pakistan, where a White House report issued this week conceded there is ''''no clear path to defeating the insurgency.'''' But she is without Richard C. Holbrooke, the veteran diplomat who died in December and has been replaced by the low-key Marc Grossman, who has shunned the spotlight that Mr. Holbrooke so enjoyed.\r\nOne of the critical questions is whether Mrs. Clinton, who won the argument on an intervention with Libya, will see her influence expand when Mr. Gates leaves -- or whether her success will depend on teaming up with the new defense secretary.\r\n''''You get the impression that she is taking a larger role,'''' said Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who ran against Mr. Obama in 2008. ''''We had a classified briefing the other day on Libya with both Gates and Clinton, and Hillary did 90 percent of the talking.'''' (That may have been partly because Mr. Gates had already made it clear that he had reservations about entering the Libyan conflict.)\r\nThomas E. Donilon, who became national security adviser last fall, could prove influential in some personnel choices. An experienced manager, he appears to have a far closer relationship to Mr. Obama than did his predecessor, Gen. James L. Jones.\r\nMr. Donilon is viewed as a fan of General Cartwright, long considered a leading candidate for chairman of the Joint Chiefs. General Cartwright''s reputation is based on his expertise in complex, high-technology issues, like missile defense and cyberwar, that appeal to the president.\r\nBut there are other contenders -- Adm. James G. Stavridis, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, Gen. Ray Odierno and Gen. Norton A. Schwartz among them -- and Mr. Obama''s final choice for chairman will be particularly telling.\r\nFor his next chairman, Mr. Obama has a choice between an independent-minded general or one who represents the military establishment. During the Afghanistan-Pakistan policymaking debate, General Cartwright was said to have voiced concerns about a large commitment of additional troops to Afghanistan -- a view that aligned him more with Mr. Biden than with Mr. Gates or Admiral Mullen.\r\nCoupled with an inquiry into his command and disciplinary decisions involving a female subordinate -- General Cartwright was cleared of all wrongdoing -- some senior officers express concern about his leadership style and management decisions.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: April 7, 2011\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Among those who have been mentioned as candidates to fill coming vacancies on President Obama''s national security team are, from left to right: Leon E.

But some others in the hacker world are sick of its games.\r\nAfter six weeks of attacks - and hundreds of sarcastic Twitter posts - a number of people, offended by the exposure of innocent Internet users'' personal information and irritated by the bravado, are working to stop LulzSec by investigating and revealing its members'' identities to the world, and especially to the F.B.I.\r\nOn Friday, The Guardian reported that a disaffected former associate known only as m_nerva had leaked logs of conversations that LulzSec''s members had among themselves in online chat rooms.\r\nThe logs cover a period from May 31 to June 4, which covers the LulzSec hacks on Sony and P.B.S. Under the apparent leadership of one of the hackers, known only as Sabu, between six and eight group members discuss media coverage of their deeds and rail against a rival hacker, called The Jester, who has been publishing what he says are leaks about LulzSec on his Web site. The Jester is known as a defender of the United States military and an opponent of WikiLeaks and radical Muslim groups, which he has hit with crippling amounts of traffic in what are known as denial-of-service attacks.\r\nAfter LulzSec hacked a company affiliated with the F.B.I. on June 3, the logs reveal that two members quit, fearing reprisals from the authorities. The two were "not up for the heat", Sabu typed. He added: "You realise we smacked the FBI today. This means everyone in here must remain extremely secure."\r\nIn a Twitter post directed toward m_nerva on Tuesday, LulzSec promised reprisals for the leak of the logs. "Remember this tweet," it said, "for I know you''ll read it: your cold jail cell will be haunted with our endless laughter. Game over, child."\r\nBut it seems that another group, calling itself Web Ninjas, has been revealing personal tidbits and photos of what it says are LulzSec members on its blog, LulzSec Exposed. It has also posted a chat transcript which seems to be the same one obtained by The Guardian.\r\n"Web ninjas decided to give them a taste of their own LULZ and we have shown them that they are not the ''Internet Gods'' they think they are. ''Web Ninjas'' does and will stop Lulzsec," it wrote. "We are here to stand for HACK VICTIMS."\r\nAnd a group called Backtrace Security says it has been hunting the people behind LulzSec since February. Citing the dangers of its continuing tussle with LulzSec, Backtrace declined to disclose its principals'' identities. But one who uses the handle Asherah said he and his colleagues published the LulzSec members'' nicknames and, in some cases, real names online in February, and have been assisting the F.B.I. since March. As LulzSec''s hacking activity - and Twitter publicity machine - heated up, they moved on June 7 to publicize the names on Twitter, apparently setting off a kind of hacker civil war.\r\n"They were rampaging, and clearly not willing to stop," Asherah said. "Despite the rumors, they''re not very accomplished hackers. They''re attention-drunk."\r\nLulzSec claims to hack for the "lulz," or fun of it, unlike their more political cousins Anonymous, a nebulous and large movement. "That doesn''t mean politics don''t enter, that means it enters when it''s lulzy, when it''s hilarious," said Gabriella Coleman, an assistant professor at New York University who studies Anonymous. "The lulz matters in Anonymous, but the political wings are really political, and they have to keep the lulz tamed." Though separate, several days ago the two entities declared a joint cyberwar against governments and security companies called Operation Anti-Security.\r\nBut it is not clear whether LulzSec can fight wars on multiple online fronts and continue to strike such visible targets while others try to bring it down.\r\n\r\n•\r\nHackers Claim to Breach Senate''s Web Site \r\n•\r\nGroup Posts What It Says Are Iranian Government E-Mails \r\n•\r\nHacking Group Lulz Security Says It Is Ending Spree \r\n•\r\nGuilty Plea in Theft of Data About iPad Owners \r\n•\r\nHacking Group Says It Brought Down C.I.A.

''''However, it appears the police and your lawmakers of Orlando do not.''''\r\nA 2006 city ordinance requires organizations to obtain permits to feed groups of 25 people or more in downtown parks. The law was passed after numerous complaints by residents and businesses owners about the twice-weekly feedings in Lake Eola Park, city officials said. The law limits any group to no more than two permits per year per park.\r\nSince June 1, the city police have arrested 25 Orlando Food Not Bombs volunteers without permits as they provided meals to large groups of homeless people in the park. One of those arrested last week on trespassing charges was Keith McHenry, a co-founder of the first Food Not Bombs chapter in 1980 in Cambridge, Mass. He remained in the Orange County Jail on Thursday awaiting a bond hearing.\r\nThis week Anonymous offered a ''''cease-fire'''' if no volunteers were arrested during Wednesday evening''s feeding of the homeless. But the police arrested two volunteers, and on Thursday morning Anonymous disrupted the Web site Downtown Orlando, which promotes redevelopment there and is run by the city. An organization spokeswoman confirmed the attack but declined to comment, referring questions to the mayor''s office.\r\nA spokeswoman for Mayor Buddy Dyer, whose re-election campaign site was disabled on Tuesday, called the attack on the Downtown Orlando site an ''''inconvenience.'''' She said the city would not change its policy of arresting volunteers who feed homeless people without a permit.\r\n''''We will continue to enforce the city ordinance,'''' said the spokeswoman, who asked not to be identified out of a concern she would become a target of Anonymous. ''''We must continue to focus on what our Orlando residents want and not the desires of others from outside the community.''''\r\nThe attack on the Orlando Web sites was the second on a city or state government in two weeks. Last week, hackers gained access to the computer system of the Arizona Department of Public Safety and released law-enforcement records.\r\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Orlando Police Department are investigating, officials said.\r\nMembers of Orlando Food Not Bombs condemned the cyberattacks. ''''We have absolutely nothing to do with Anonymous or any other group that is doing this kind of thing,'''' said one member, Ben Markeson. ''''And what Anonymous is doing is a distraction from the real issue at hand.''''\r\nMr. Markeson said the Orlando mayor and City Council members had attempted to ''''criminalize poverty'''' by passing a series of ordinances intended to ''''hide the homeless.''''\r\n''''Mayor Dyer wants to hide the poor and the hungry people living in our community,'''' he said.\r\nThe mayor''s spokesman denied the allegation, saying: ''''Nothing could be further from the truth. The city has a strong relationship with our region''s homeless providers and will continue to dedicate resources and services that assist our homeless population.''''\r\nAnonymous has become known for prominent denial-of-service attacks on high-traffic Web sites. A denial-of-service attack takes place when an overwhelming crush of Web traffic is intentionally sent to a Web site until it is incapacitated and knocked off line.\r\nAnonymous members rallied a call-to-arms against the city as part of a campaign it dubbed Operation Orlando. Its members promised that future arrests of volunteers helping the homeless would be met with fresh attacks. ''''For every arrested person,'''' the group said on Twitter, ''''Anonymous will deface or assault TEN websites in Orlando.''''\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: July 1, 2011\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Volunteers were arrested at Lake Eola Park in Orlando, Fla., last month after feeding homeless people without a permit.\r\nKeith McHenry, a co-founder of the first Food Not Bombs group, serving food at the park in May.

John Markoff contributed reporting from San Francisco and Somini Sengupta from Las Vegas.\r\n\r\nSECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 11\r\n\r\nLENGTH: 1161 words\r\n\r\nSHANGHAI -- An American cybersecurity company issued a report on Wednesday saying that it had identified a single perpetrator of cyberattacks that lasted up to five years on a wide range of governments, American corporations and even United Nations groups, and that the pattern of targets suggested the attacker was a ''''state actor.''''\r\nHowever, as with a number of other alarming recent reports on computer spying, the study offered few details that would allow independent verification, and it was difficult to immediately assess the damage done. It did not identify the location of the attacking computer system, say what kinds of documents or information were stolen, or offer any direct evidence of a state''s involvement.\r\nThe company, McAfee, said it had identified 72 targets -- 49 of them American, including 14 federal, state and county agencies and 11 defense contractors -- and also informed law enforcement agencies, which it said were investigating.\r\nThe White House referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security. At a news conference on other matters, that department''s secretary, Janet Napolitano, said: ''''We became aware of the McAfee report, I think, today, which is when it was released to the press, as well. We obviously will evaluate it, look at it and pursue what needs to be pursued in terms of its contents.''''\r\nOne of the few named organizations, the World Anti-Doping Agency, cast doubt on the report''s assertion that the agency had been subject to a 14-month attack that began in August 2009. In a statement, the director general, David Howman, acknowledged that the agency had experienced an e-mail breach in February 2008, but that ''''at this stage, W.A.D.A. has no evidence from its security experts of the intrusions as listed by McAfee and the agency has yet to be convinced that they took place.''''\r\nMcAfee, which was recently acquired by Intel, said it released the report to coincide with the start on Wednesday of the annual Black Hat technical security conference in Las Vegas. Briefings were scheduled to be delivered at the conference. Details of the study were first published on the Web site of Vanity Fair.\r\nAsked why McAfee decided not to identify most of the corporations that were targets in the attacks, the company said that the corporations were worried about being identified and alarming shareholders or customers.\r\nCybersecurity is now a major international concern, with hackers gaining access to sensitive corporate and military secrets, including intellectual property. The report comes after high-profile computer network attacks aimed at the International Monetary Fund, Sony and the Lockheed Martin Corporation, America''s largest military contractor.\r\nConcern over attacks being carried out by nation-states is rising sharply, particularly after Google said last year that Chinese hackers stole some of the company''s source code. Many security experts say the Chinese government has built up a sophisticated cyberwarfare unit and that the government might be partnering with professional hackers. But the list of entities, government or private, suspected of hacking campaigns, is a long one.\r\nJeff Moss, an Internet security expert who founded the Black Hat Conference, said it would be hard to narrow down the suspects in a broad campaign. ''''China is a pretty convenient punching bag,'''' he said.\r\nThe company''s 14-page report, written by Dmitri Alperovitch, McAfee''s vice president for threat research, traced the attacks to at least 2006 and said they peaked in 2009. It calls the attacks highly sophisticated and said targets included governments, companies, and organizations in Canada, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland and Britain.\r\n''''After painstaking analysis of the logs, even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim organizations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators,'''' the report said.\r\nMcAfee said it identified a single perpetrator in March, when it discovered detailed logs of attacks while reviewing the contents of a server it had discovered in 2009 as part of an investigation into security breaches at defense companies. Joris Evers, a spokesman for McAfee, said the server was in a Western country but that he could not be more specific.\r\nMcAfee called the attacks Operation Shady RAT -- RAT stands for remote access tool, a type of software used to control networked computers.\r\nThe duration of the attacks ranged from a month to what McAfee said was a sustained 28-month attack against an Olympic committee of an unidentified Asian nation.\r\nWhat was done with the data ''''is still largely an open question,'''' Mr. Alperovitch wrote in the report. ''''However, if even a fraction of it is used to build better competing products or beat a competitor at a key negotiation (due to having stolen the other team''s playbook), the loss represents a massive economic threat.''''\r\nMr. Moss said subjects of attacks should be more forthcoming. ''''Companies do the public a disservice by not revealing when these things happen,'''' he said.\r\nIn mid-May, the Obama administration proposed creating international computer security standards with penalties for countries and organizations that fell short. The strategy calls for officials from the State Department, the Pentagon, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and the Department of Homeland Security to work with their counterparts around the world to come up with international standards.\r\nObama administration officials said privately at the time that the hope was that the initiative would prod China and Russia into allowing more Internet freedom, cracking down on intellectual property theft and enacting stricter laws to protect computer users'' privacy.\r\nIn February, a Canadian federal cabinet minister said hackers, perhaps from China, had compromised computers in two Canadian government departments in early January, leaving bureaucrats with little or no Internet access for nearly two months. The minister, Stockwell B. Day Jr., the president of the Treasury Board, called the attack a ''''significant one'''' that went after financial records.\r\nAlso in February, McAfee released a report saying that at least five multinational oil and gas companies had suffered computer network attacks by a group of hackers based in China. Beijing has strongly denied any role in computer network attacks, and insisted it has been a frequent victim of such attacks itself.\r\nOn Wednesday, China''s Foreign Ministry did not respond to requests for comment about the latest McAfee report.\r\nBut last month, at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, said, ''''The Chinese government opposes hacking in all its manifestations.''''\r\nHe added: ''''Hacking is an international issue, with which China also falls victim. China is willing to conduct international cooperation in this regard. We are dissatisfied with some people''s irresponsible remarks that link hacker attacks with the Chinese government.''''\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: August 4, 2011\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper', 'robbie');

This year was a particularly rocky one between the countries, so interest has intensified.\r\nOver all, the report described what is generally known:\r\nChina''s People''s Liberation Army -- with some 1.25 million ground troops, the largest in the world -- is on track to achieve its goal of building a modern, regionally focused force by 2020. The Chinese military remains focused on Taiwan, which it claims as part of its sovereign territory, and it has deployed as many as 1,200 short-range missiles aimed in its direction. Moreover, it is developing antiship ballistic missiles, potentially capable of attacking American aircraft carriers.\r\nIt is also developing its own aircraft carriers, and is already in sea trials with a refitted Soviet-era carrier from Ukraine -- a development the report anticipated, but which occurred after it was printed. Finally, China is developing a new-generation stealth jet fighter, the J-20, which it boldly tested in Beijing in January during a visit by Robert M. Gates, then the defense secretary.\r\nMr. Schiffer said that no single development led him to describe China''s arms buildup as ''''potentially destabilizing,'''' although Pentagon officials had increasingly said they were concerned about China''s military intentions in the Pacific. Instead, he said, he used the phrase because of China''s lack of transparency and its trends in military prowess.\r\n''''It''s a combination of the lack of understanding that''s been created by the opacity of their system, but it is also because there are very real questions given the overall trends and trajectory in the scope and the scale of China''s military modernization efforts,'''' Mr. Schiffer said. ''''I wouldn''t put it on any one particular platform or any one particular system. There''s nothing particularly magical about any one particular item.''''\r\nThe report also said that numerous intrusions into computer systems around the world in 2010 appeared to have originated in China, and that developing capabilities for cyberwarfare ''''is consistent'''' with authoritative Chinese military writing. The report said that two Chinese military doctrinal writings -- ''''Science of Strategy'''' and ''''Science of Campaigns'''' -- identified ''''information warfare as integral to achieving information superiority and an effective means for countering a stronger foe.''''\r\nThe report estimates that China''s total military spending for 2010 was more than $160 billion.

They were also unable to resolve whether the president had the power to proceed with such an attack without informing Congress.\r\nIn the end, American officials rejected cyberwarfare and used conventional aircraft, cruise missiles and drones to strike the Libyan air-defense missiles and radars used by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi''s government.\r\nThis previously undisclosed debate among a small circle of advisers demonstrates that cyberoffensives are a growing form of warfare. The question the United States faces is whether and when to cross the threshold into overt cyberattacks.\r\nLast year, a Stuxnet computer worm apparently wiped out a part of Iran''s nuclear centrifuges and delayed its ability to produce nuclear fuel. Although no entity has acknowledged being the source of the poisonous code, some evidence suggests that the virus was an American-Israeli project. And the Pentagon and military contractors regularly repel attacks on their computer networks -- many coming from China and Russia.\r\nThe Obama administration is revving up the nation''s digital capabilities, while publicly emphasizing only its efforts to defend vital government, military and public infrastructure networks.\r\n''''We don''t want to be the ones who break the glass on this new kind of warfare,'''' said James Andrew Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, where he specializes in technology and national security.\r\nThat reluctance peaked during planning for the opening salvos of the Libya mission, and it was repeated on a smaller scale several weeks later, when military planners suggested a far narrower computer-network attack to prevent Pakistani radars from spotting helicopters carrying Navy Seal commandos on the raid that killed Osama bin Laden on May 2.\r\nAgain, officials decided against it. Instead, specially modified, radar-evading Black Hawk helicopters ferried the strike team, and a still-secret stealthy surveillance drone was deployed.\r\n''''These cybercapabilities are still like the Ferrari that you keep in the garage and only take out for the big race and not just for a run around town, unless nothing else can get you there,'''' said one Obama administration official briefed on the discussions.\r\nThe debate about a potential cyberattack against Libya was described by more than a half-dozen officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the classified planning.\r\nIn the days ahead of the American-led airstrikes to take down Libya''s integrated air-defense system, a more serious debate considered the military effectiveness -- and potential legal complications -- of using cyberattacks to blind Libyan radars and missiles.\r\n''''They were seriously considered because they could cripple Libya''s air defense and lower the risk to pilots, but it just didn''t pan out,'''' said a senior Defense Department official.\r\nAfter a discussion described as thorough and never vituperative, the cyberwarfare proposals were rejected before they reached the senior political levels of the White House.\r\nGen. Carter F. Ham, the head of the military''s Africa Command, which led the two-week American air campaign against Libya until NATO assumed full control of the operation on March 31, would not comment on any proposed cyberattacks. In an interview, he said only that ''''no capability that I ever asked for was denied.''''\r\nSenior officials said one of the central reasons a cyberoffensive was rejected for Libya was that it might not have been ready for use in time, given that the rebel city of Benghazi was on the verge of being overrun by government forces.\r\nWhile popular fiction and films depict cyberattacks as easy to mount -- only a few computer keystrokes needed -- in reality it takes significant digital snooping to identify potential entry points and susceptible nodes in a linked network of communications systems, radars and missiles like that operated by the Libyan government, and then to write and insert the proper poisonous codes.\r\n''''It''s the cyberequivalent of fumbling around in the dark until you find the doorknob,'''' Mr. Lewis said. ''''It takes time to find the vulnerabilities. Where is the thing that I can exploit to disrupt the network?''''\r\nHad the computer-network attack gone ahead, administration officials said they were confident it could have been confined to Libyan networks and offered high promise of disrupting the regime''s integrated air-defense system.\r\nOne unresolved concern was whether ordering a cyberattack on Libya might create domestic legal restrictions on war-making by the executive branch without Congressional permission. One question was whether the War Powers Resolution -- which requires the executive to formally report to lawmakers when it has introduced forces into ''''hostilities'''' and sets a 60-day limit on such deployments if Congress does not authorize them to continue -- would be required for an attack purely in cyberspace.\r\nThe War Powers Resolution, a Vietnam-era law enacted over President Richard M. Nixon''s veto, does not define ''''hostilities.'''' In describing its actions to Congress and the American people, the White House argued that its use of conventional forces in the Libyan intervention fell short of the level of hostilities requiring Congressional permission under either the Constitution or the resolution, citing the lack of ground forces and the supporting role the United States was playing in a multilateral effort to fulfill a United Nations resolution. Some officials also expressed concern about revealing American technological capabilities to potential enemies for what seemed like a relatively minor security threat to the United States.\r\nIn the end, Libya''s air-defense network was dangerous but not exceptionally robust. American surveillance identified its locations, and it was degraded through conventional attacks.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: October 18, 2011\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\r\n', 'robbie');

China, predictably, was enraged by what it viewed as American meddling.\r\nFor all its echoes of the 1800s, not to mention the cold war, the showdown in the South China Sea augurs a new type of maritime conflict -- one that is playing out from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean, where fuel-hungry economic powers, newly accessible undersea energy riches and even changes in the earth''s climate are conspiring to create a 21st-century contest for the seas.\r\nChina is not alone in its maritime ambitions. Turkey has clashed with Cyprus and stoked tensions with Greece and Israel over natural-gas fields that lie under the eastern Mediterranean. Several powers, including Russia, Canada and the United States, are eagerly circling the Arctic, where melting polar ice is opening up new shipping routes and the tantalizing possibility of vast oil and gas deposits beneath.\r\n''''This hunt for resources is going to consume large bodies of water around the world for at least the next couple of decades,'''' Mrs. Clinton said in a recent interview, describing a global competition that sounds like a watery Great Game.\r\nSuch tensions are sure to shadow President Obama this week, as he meets with leaders from China and other Asian countries in Honolulu and on the Indonesian island of Bali. Administration officials said they expected all sides to tamp down disagreements, though that won''t mask the coming conflicts.\r\n''''Underlying all of this is the recognition that an increasing share of oil resources is offshore,'''' said Daniel Yergin, an energy expert and author of a new book, ''''The Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of the Modern World.'''' ''''When you have energy resources on land,'''' he said, ''''you know where things stand. When they''re offshore, things can get murkier.''''\r\nTwenty-nine million barrels of oil a day, one-third of global production, now come from offshore fields, Mr. Yergin said, a share that will rise steadily. The South China Sea alone is estimated to have 61 billion barrels of petroleum -- oil and gas -- plus 54 billion yet to be discovered, while the Arctic is projected to have 238 billion barrels, with possibly twice that in undiscovered sources.\r\nAs countries race to erect drilling rigs and send oil exploration vessels to comb the seabed, conflicting maritime claims are helping to fuel a naval arms race. It is no coincidence that the countries with the fastest-growing navies are those with stakes in these energy zones.\r\nChina expanded from 2 Soviet-era destroyers in 1990 to 13 modern destroyers in 2010, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. In its drive for a blue-water navy, one that operates in the deep waters of open oceans, it is also building an aircraft carrier. Malaysia and Vietnam are beefing up their navies with frigates and submarines. India, which wants to make sure it has access to the Far East, is bulking up. And the Israeli Navy is pushing for more vessels to counter Turkish warships circling Israeli drilling rigs.\r\n''''Countries want to make sure they have the ability to develop resources and to make sure their trading routes are protected,'''' said David L. Goldwyn, a former special envoy for international energy affairs at the State Department.\r\nThis competition is also behind calls for the United States to bolster its naval strength, even at a time of budget cuts. Mitt Romney, considered by many the Republican front-runner in the presidential race, declared recently he would ''''reverse the hollowing of our Navy and announce an initiative to increase the shipbuilding rate from 9 per year to 15.'''' With anemic building rates and tighter maintenance budgets, analysts say, the Navy has been forced to cope with an aging fleet that some say is not up to its challenges.\r\nEven so, the Obama administration has been an active practitioner of gunboat diplomacy, a term that refers to achieving foreign-policy objectives through vivid displays of naval might. Last fall, Mr. Obama sent the aircraft carrier George Washington to the Yellow Sea for joint exercises with South Korea, sending a message to both North Korea and its key backer, China. The move echoed the Clinton administration''s decision in 1996 to send the Seventh Fleet to warn China against attacking Taiwan.\r\nThe United States has used gunboat diplomacy in Asia at least since 1853, when Commodore Matthew C. Perry sailed his fleet into Tokyo Bay, intimidating Japan into opening up to foreign trade. But these days, the Chinese are fashioning an Asian version of the Monroe Doctrine to press their imperial ambitions.\r\nFOR Mr. Obama, whose roots in Hawaii and Indonesia have imbued him with a strong Pacific worldview, the drawdown in Iraq and Afghanistan gives him a good pretext to turn his gaze eastward. The United States has worked to shore up its ties to old Asian allies, like Japan and South Korea, as well as new giants like India. The goal, though administration officials are loath to say it publicly, is to assemble a coalition to counterbalance China''s growing power.\r\nOn a recent tour of Asia, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta pledged not to retreat from the region. ''''If anything,'''' he said, ''''we''re going to strengthen our presence in the Pacific.'''' This week, Mr. Obama is expected to announce an agreement with Australia for a permanent American military presence there.\r\nOn land, the race for energy supplies is not new, of course. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the United States maneuvered to keep Russia out of oil-rich Iran. Today, China is busy cutting deals in energy-rich Africa. But technology has changed the equation, putting undersea oil and gas fields into play as never before.\r\n''''At root, it''s a question of when and how you will have these conflicts,'''' said James B. Steinberg, a former deputy secretary of state with experience in all three regions. ''''Will countries see these as win-win opportunities, or will they see them as zero-sum competitions?''''\r\nFor China, the South China Sea has long been crucial as a supply route for oil and other raw materials to fuel its economy. China''s claims have deep historical roots, dating from the 1940s, when Chiang Kai-shek''s Nationalists drew a dotted line in the shape of a cow''s tongue extending south of China, embracing most the sea and two disputed island chains, the Paracels and the Spratlys.\r\nQuarrels over these hunks of volcanic rock wouldn''t matter much, except that China, Vietnam and the Philippines are running into one another in the race for oil. Last spring, in two separate incidents, Vietnam accused Chinese vessels of deliberately cutting the seismic survey cables of an oil exploration ship. A former American official said his nightmare scenario would be a Chinese warship''s firing on an Exxon oil-drilling ship.\r\nIf the South China Sea is simmering, then the eastern Mediterranean is seething. There, claims to huge natural-gas reserves off the coast of Cyprus and Lebanon have raised tensions with Turkey, which occupies half of Cyprus, as well as with Israel. Cyprus and Israel are drilling for gas, angering Turkey. The militant Islamic group Hezbollah, in Lebanon, has threatened to attack Israeli gas rigs.\r\nFurther complicating this is the bitter rift between Turkey and Israel after the deadly Israeli commando interception of a Turkish flotilla trying to transport aid to Palestinians in Gaza last year.\r\n''''The Turks are saying, ''The Israelis humiliated us; what can we do in return?'''''' said Charles K. Ebinger, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''''Part of it is just the greater assertiveness of Turkey''s foreign policy everywhere.''''\r\nPerhaps the least dangerous arena of competition lies in the frigid north, partly because experts believe that many of the Arctic''s mineral deposits lie within one or another of the 200-mile exclusive economic zones of the countries that ring the ocean. But even countries with no Arctic coastline, like China and South Korea, are sending icebreakers there to explore weather patterns and fish migration.\r\nIronically, the biggest bone of contention there is between two stalwart allies, the United States and Canada. Melting ice has opened up the fabled Northwest Passage, which runs through an archipelago of islands in northern Canada. The United States views the passage as an international waterway, giving American ships unlimited access. The Canadian government insists it is an inland waterway, meaning that foreign ships can use it only with Ottawa''s approval.\r\nCanada and the United States are highly unlikely to go to war, of course, though the wrangling could keep maritime lawyers busy for years. As temperatures climb, officials warn, tempers may follow. ''''It''s a serious legal dispute,'''' Mr. Steinberg said. ''''When it is ice-free, there will be some real issues.''''\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: November 13, 2011\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: GRAPHICS: Navies Ramping Up: Three Contested Regions\r\nThe Arctic: It may hold more than one-fifth of global oil and gas resources.

Earlier, the group released 50,000 credit card numbers of Stratfor customers.\r\nIdentityFinder, a data-protection software maker, found that in their latest release Stratfor''s hackers had dumped a total of 68,063 unique credit card numbers, of which 36,000 were not yet expired. It also confirmed that the hackers had released 859,311 unique email addresses, 860,160 encrypted passwords and 50,569 phone numbers.\r\nThere could be more stolen data to come. Last Monday, Barrett Brown, an Anonymous spokesman, wrote in a post that the real goal of the breach was to publish 3.3 million e-mails between Stratfor employees and its intelligence sources and clients.\r\nThose emails have yet to be published, which leaves Stratfor in the position of trying to recover from the attack without knowing whether the worst is over.\r\nThe Stratfor breach first surfaced on Saturday, when hackers defaced the group''s Web site with their own message.

Modern war plans can become mired in a bog of air defenses, mines, missiles, electronic jamming and computer-network attacks meant to degrade American advantages in technology and hardware.\r\nIt is a lesson that potential enemies drew from the way American public support for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan plummeted as armored vehicles -- each costing millions of dollars -- were broken and their troops killed and maimed by roadside bombs costing only a few hundred dollars apiece.\r\nChina and Iran were identified as the countries that were leading the pursuit of ''''asymmetric means'''' to counter American military force, according to the new strategy document, which cautioned that these relatively inexpensive measures were spreading to terrorist and guerrilla cells.\r\nAt his announcement at the Pentagon last week, Mr. Obama said the country should invest in ''''the ability to operate in environments where adversaries try to deny us access.''''\r\nThe new strategy specifically orders that efforts to counter the threat, which the military calls ''''anti-access, area-denial,'''' become one of the 10 primary missions of the American military. That will help define how the four armed services compete for shares of a shrinking Pentagon budget.\r\n''''The United States must maintain its ability to project power in areas in which our access and freedom to operate are challenged,'''' the strategy document said.\r\n''''Sophisticated adversaries will use asymmetric capabilities, to include electronic and cyberwarfare, ballistic and cruise missiles, advanced air defenses, mining and other methods to complicate our operational calculus.''''\r\nFor example, in recent exercises by the naval arm of the Revolutionary Guards, Iran has practiced ''''swarming'''' attacks by a number of small, fast boats that could be loaded with high explosives; if one such boat got through, it might blast a hole in the hull of a major American warship.\r\n''''Iran''s navy -- especially the naval arm of Iran''s Revolutionary Guards -- has invested in vessels and armaments that are well suited to asymmetric warfare, rather than the sort of ship-to-ship conflict that Iran would surely lose,'''' Michael Singh, managing director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, wrote in a recent essay for Foreign Policy.\r\nWith Chinese and Russian help, Mr. Singh added, Iran is also fielding sophisticated mines, midget submarines and mobile antiship cruise missiles.\r\nNathan Freier, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, ''''Iran''s capabilities are best suited for imposing high costs on those who might need to force their way through the Strait of Hormuz, and on those in the region whom the Iranians perceive as being complicit in enabling foreign access.''''\r\nThe potential challenge from China is even more significant, according to analysts. China has a fleet of diesel-electric attack submarines, which can operate quietly and effectively in waters near China''s shore to threaten foreign warships. China also fields short-, medium- and long-range missiles that could put warships at risk, and has layers of radar and surface-to-air missiles along its coast.\r\nFinding, identifying and striking an American warship is a complex military operation. But the thicket of Chinese defenses could oblige an American aircraft carrier and its strike group to operate hundreds of miles farther out to sea, decreasing the number of attack sorties its aircraft could mount in a day and diminishing their effectiveness.\r\nPerhaps most worrisome is China''s focus on electronic warfare and computer-network attacks, which might blunt the accuracy of advanced American munitions guided by satellite.\r\nTo counter these threats, the Air Force and Navy set up an office to develop complementary tactics and weaponry for what they are calling air-sea battle.\r\nOne idea is to attack an outer ring of enemy air defenses with F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, opening an alley for an F-22 stealth jet carrying sensitive surveillance pods to fly deeper into contested territory, where it could, for example, guide a powerful sea-launched cruise missile to a mobile or hidden target.\r\nAccording to Lt. Gen. Herbert J. Carlisle, the Air Force deputy chief of staff for operations, plans and requirements, American computer warfare techniques could be used to spoil an adversary''s decision-making process. ''''If we can give them bad information, or we can make them doubt the good information they have,'''' he said.\r\nVice Adm. Bruce W. Clingan, the Navy''s deputy chief for operations, plans and strategy, said the military was carefully studying anti-access, area-denial techniques to pinpoint potential weaknesses in an adversary''s ability to identify and strike American targets.\r\n''''Do you take out his ability to shoot? Do you take him out once he''s shot? Do you deny him accuracy once the missile is airborne and then you create a greater ''miss distance''?'''' Admiral Clingan said. ''''You have to work your way across that entire effect chain and how you''re going to do those things to keep those missiles from threatening you.''''\r\nGen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will soon release his concept for operating in an anti-access, area-denial environment. The 65-page directive will identify 30 capabilities that the armed forces will need to carry out missions across contested battlefields.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: January 10, 2012\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\r\n', 'robbie');

Neither the Israeli economy nor flights in and out of the country were endangered, and the sites appeared to be recovering within hours, but the assault left many Israelis feeling vulnerable.\r\nYoni Shemesh, who is responsible for the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Web site, said that his team had already begun preparing for an attack a few days ago and went on high alert after the Ynet report.\r\n''''We are putting up blocks to the hackers,'''' he told Israel Radio at noon, about three hours after the attack started.

Instead, many security experts throw the burden back to consumers by recommending that consumers take a more vigilant approach to protecting their personal data \r\n\r\n9:02 p.m. | Updated\r\nBarbara Scott just hit the trifecta of computer security breaches.\r\nSince the New Year, Ms. Scott has been a victim of three separate cyberattacks. Two weeks ago, the online auction site eBay said in an e-mail to her that there had been suspicious activity on her account. On Monday, she received an e-mail from Zappos and another from 6PM, two online shoe retailers owned by Amazon. Both messages alerted her that - once again - her information had been compromised.\r\n"It''s disturbing," said Ms. Scott, who works in San Diego as a director at Redemtech, a technology services business. "Companies have to do a better job protecting our privacy. You would think companies like eBay and Amazon have the financial backing and wherewithal to take the proper security measures."\r\nThe breaches at Zappos and 6PM may have compromised account information for 24 million customers - the largest breach of an online retailer since a series of cyberattacks against Sony last year that compromised 100 million customer accounts. The attacks point to an unsettling new world in which even the supposed stalwarts of the Internet - Amazon, eBay and even the security giants paid to keep hackers at bay - cannot seem to keep personal information safe.\r\nAnd when there is a security breach, the companies and computer security experts more often than not resort to telling their consumers that it is up to them to protect their data stored on the company''s servers.\r\nZappos''s chief executive, Tony Hsieh, said Sunday that customer names, encrypted passwords, phone numbers, e-mail and mailing addresses and the last four digits of their credit card numbers might have been stolen in the attack. But he noted that the company quickly reset all passwords and that a separate database containing critical credit card information had not been breached.\r\nMr. Hsieh- who wrote the book "Delivering Happiness" and regularly invites customers to tour Zappos'' facilities - provided no explanation about why the data was vulnerable. He directed customers to an e-mail address because its customer service lines "simply aren''t capable" of handling the number of expected customer inquiries.\r\nThat response angered Eric Seftel, a Zappos customer, who posted a reply to Zappos'' e-mail alert on The New York Times''s Bits blog: "That''s it? That''s how you respond to a security exposure that may require me to change my password on a large number of other sites to protect myself? That''s how little you think of your customers, just drop this glib little note and wash your hands of the whole affair? You have a legal and moral obligation to protect my information."\r\nIn an e-mail to The New York Times on Monday, Mr. Hsieh said the company did have a security breach response plan in place before the attack but could not discuss the specifics or about how it was breached. "Our plan specifically includes not disclosing details of our security processes or procedures," Mr. Hsieh said. "Just like you would not expect a casino to disclose when the security guards change shifts."\r\nThe breaches at Amazon''s sites, combined with several recent cyberattacks, could threaten to shake consumer confidence online. Over the year-end holidays, hackers who said they were members of the group Anonymous attacked the Web site of Strategic Forecasting, a research firm that specializes in security and intelligence. They dumped personal and payment details for thousands of subscribers.\r\nIn a separate attack on India''s military and intelligence servers two weeks ago, a different group of hackers managed to find and post a segment of source code belonging to Symantec, the largest security software company.\r\n"There are a lot of people that are going to seriously reconsider before they purchase anything else on the Internet," Jerry Irvine, a member of the National Cyber Security Task Force, said in an interview on Monday.\r\nThe White House is working on a plan to increase consumers'' confidence in the security of e-commerce sites. Its initiative, called the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace, works with major vendors - like banks, technology companies and cellphone service providers - to adopt higher standards for the way companies verify user identities and store personal data online.\r\nBut the program is less than a year old and, Mr. Irvine says, intended to be only one step in a larger process to protect customers'' identities and personal information on the Web. "These breaches are going to be an education for people to take a more layered approach to their security," he said.\r\nWith companies unable to provide a good solution, many companies and security experts throw the burden back to consumers.\r\n"It is always a good practice to use different passwords on different Web sites," Mr. Hsieh advised. Mr. Irvine recommends that consumers protect their personal data more vigilantly. He suggests not using e-mail addresses as user names, creating a unique password for every Web site and refraining from saving personal and payment details online.\r\n"That is the only way you''re going to be secure," Mr. Irvine said.\r\nMs. Scott said she already used complex alphanumeric passwords and updated them on a regular basis. "Beyond that, I guess I have to be more conscious about who I choose to do business with online," she said. "How hard can it be to find a safe place online to buy shoes?"\r\n\r\n•\r\nSoftware Helps Identify Anonymous Writers or Helps Them Stay That Way \r\n•\r\nAmazon''s Long Courtship of Zappos \r\n•\r\nAmazon to Acquire Zappos for $847 Million \r\n•\r\nOnline Shoppers Are Rooting for the Little Guy \r\n•\r\nWill the Kindle Fire Kill E-Readers? \r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: January 19, 2012\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nDOCUMENT-TYPE: News\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Web Blog\r\n', 'robbie');

But they are mainly a scaling back of previously projected spending -- the delights of the Washington budget games.\r\nThis year, Pentagon spending will total $531 billion. In 2017, it will rise to $567 billion. Factoring in inflation, that amounts to only a minuscule 1.6 percent real cut. (Both numbers exclude war spending -- $115 billion this year.)\r\nAfter a decade of unrestrained Pentagon spending increases, President Obama deserves credit for putting on the brakes. The cuts are a credible down payment on his pledge to reduce projected defense spending by $487 billion in the next decade. They are not going to be enough. In the likely absence of a bipartisan budget pact, a further automatic across-the-board 10-year cut of nearly $500 billion is to take effect starting next January.\r\nEven if a last-minute deal heads that off, the country needs to find more savings. And there is still plenty of room to cut deeper without jeopardizing national security.\r\nEarly in January, President Obama outlined a new, more pragmatic defense strategy. Republicans predictably claimed he was hollowing out the force -- but a smarter, more restrained use of force is just what the country needs to secure its vital interests.\r\nMuch of the savings will come from cutting the size of the Army and Marine Corps by almost 13 percent and stretching out purchases of planes and ships. At the same time, the military will buy more unpiloted drones, add special operations units, equip submarines to carry more cruise missiles and expand its cyberwarfare capacities.\r\nThat makes sense in a world where terrorism and unconventional attacks are a primary threat. Any plan to downsize ground forces must be matched by a credible plan to quickly build them up, if necessary.\r\nThe Pentagon also proposes a new round of domestic base closings, a less generous formula for military pay raises after 2015 and higher health insurance premiums for military retirees (families of working-age retirees now pay $500 annually), all of which we strongly support.\r\nUnfortunately, that new thinking has been dragged down by some old-style budgetary inertia. Mr. Obama needs to push the Pentagon to do better. Here are some additional cuts that make sense:\r\nSHRINK THE F-35 PROGRAM The total order of stealth fighters should be reduced to 1,000, from 2,440, saving more than $150 billion. The F-35 was designed as a low-cost, supercapable aircraft. It has become the costliest Pentagon procurement project ever and its performance has been disappointing. The Air Force, Navy and Marines need to cut their losses. Most of the savings would not come until the 2020s. Over $20 billion could be saved this decade by canceling the troubled Marine Corps variant.\r\nCUT THE NUCLEAR BUDGET Mr. Obama has declared his commitment to arms control, but there is no reflection of that in the budget plan. He needs to back it up with significant cuts in the number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons, ballistic missile submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican, offers a sensible plan to do that, and estimates that it could save $79 billion over the next decade.\r\nGO TO 10 AIRCRAFT CARRIER GROUPS The Pentagon could save $4 billion to $8 billion over a decade by revisiting the president''s unwise decision not to eliminate one of the 11 aircraft carriers with associated ships and aircraft. Ten would provide more than enough surge capacity to support naval air operations anywhere in the world.\r\nWe know that it is politically easier to continue programs that outlive their usefulness or outrun their cost estimates -- especially when Republican politicians are so eager to promise the Pentagon a blank check. And especially when the defense industry and its lobbyists are spreading so much cash around on Capitol Hill. But the country cannot afford to continue on this way. And there is no strategic argument for doing so. The era of hard choices at the Pentagon has barely begun.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: January 30, 2012\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nDOCUMENT-TYPE: Editorial\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\r\n', 'robbie');

''''And they may seek to train their own recruits or hire outsiders, with an eye toward pursuing cyberattacks. These adaptations of the terrorist threat make the F.B.I.''s counterterrorism mission that much more difficult and challenging.''''\r\nMr. Mueller said that the federal government must act swiftly to prevent such attacks and economic espionage from other countries because they pose a ''''potentially devastating'''' threat to the country''s businesses and infrastructure.\r\n''''We tend to focus on protecting our databases, protecting our infrastructure, which is absolutely an appropriate focus,'''' he said. ''''But we should not forget that you want to identify these individuals who are responsible for these crimes, investigate them, prosecute them and put them in jail for a substantial period of time.''''\r\nMr. Mueller has been particularly vocal over the past week about the issue of hacking and cybersecurity.

Sabu was identified in court papers as Hector Xavier Monsegur, a 28-year-old who operated from a sixth-floor apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.\r\nMr. Monsegur pleaded guilty in August to dozens of hacking charges.

The scientists managing the program - which the the naval research office is calling "revolutionary" - commonly refer to this mysterious perception as feeling one''s "Spidey sense" tingling, after the intuitive power of Spiderman.\r\n"Evidence is accumulating that this capability, known as intuition or intuitive decision making, enables the rapid detection of patterns in ambiguous, uncertain and time restricted information contexts," the office said, citing numerous peer-reviewed studies in cognitive psychology and neuroscience.\r\nThe program, called Enhancing Intuitive Decision Making Through Implicit Learning, will be making available $3.85 million over four years to researchers who want to investigate how intuition works. Initial proposals are due April 15, and executives at more than a dozen companies specializing in fields like logistics, software and artificial intelligence have so far expressed interest in applying for the money.\r\nThe Navy expects the research will offer insight into the scientific basis of intuition, a concept that many in the general public confuse with the supernatural. It also hopes the findings will eventually allow military scientists and planners to build sophisticated computer models of how intuition works and to design training programs to help troops learn to better use their intuitive ability.\r\n"There is a growing body of anecdotal evidence, combined with solid research efforts, that suggests intuition is a critical aspect of how we humans interact with our environment and how, ultimately, we make many of our decisions," Ivy Estabrooke, a program manager at the Office of Naval Research, said in an e-mail.\r\n"The whole goal of this research endeavor is to determine if we can develop techniques to measurably improve intuition," she added.\r\nThe impetus for the program comes from "reports and discussions with marines and soldiers returning from deployment" in recent years, said Cmdr. Joseph Cohn, also a program manager at the naval office. "These reports from the field often detailed a ''sixth sense'' or ''Spidey sense'' that alerted them to an impending attack or I.E.D., or that allowed them to respond to a novel situation without consciously analyzing the situation."\r\nThe Navy references the case of a company of Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan, who, after a Taliban ambush in the summer of 2006, said in hindsight that their intuitions had set off a warning.\r\nThey also point to the case of Staff Sgt. Martin Richburg who, after sensing something odd about a man at an Iraqi Internet cafe, managed to save the lives of 17 cafe patrons from the improvised bomb the man had planted there.\r\nOf course, such intuition is not always correct, and one of the research program''s goals is to find ways to fine-tune it. The program''s results are expected to be used in cyberwarfare, unmanned drone operations and other areas in which members of the military are called to act in situations where reliable information is not available or where the amount of information that must be processed is overwhelmingly large.\r\n"This is a very creative idea on the Navy''s part," said John Kounios, a professor of psychology at Drexel University. Mr. Kounios, whose work is among the studies cited in the announcement, said he became aware of the research program only a few days ago.\r\n"Military equipment is very expensive," he said in an e-mail, "but training is, by comparison, relatively cheap. Not only can such training help to save lives, it can help military personnel to more effectively use their equipment."\r\nMr. Kounios said he believed the Navy''s goal - to train troops how to use their intuition better - was possible, but he emphasized that the intuitive ability in question was not a supernatural one.\r\n"The term ''sixth sense'' is evocative, but risks conveying the idea that intuition is a psychic or paranormal phenomenon," he said.\r\nWhen an idea appears as an "aha" moment, Mr. Kounios added, "people often think that this is a psychic phenomenon because they don''t know where the idea came from. But it''s the product of unconscious information processing."\r\nSome studies suggest that the neural and cognitive processes involved in intuitive decision-making actually share many similarities with those involved in "implicit learning," or learning that happens without the learner being aware of what was learned or how, the Navy said.\r\nIn addition to enhanced military training, researchers also want to use the new program to develop enhanced technology. Ezra Sidran, a computer scientist, said he planned to apply for the naval research funding to investigate "unsupervised machine learning," in which a computer program independently "analyzes, remembers and learns."\r\n"When Pandora suggests a song for you or when Amazon suggests a book for you," Mr. Sidran said, "this is an example of supervised machine learning" because "you, albeit unknowingly, are supervising the learning of the machine" with each book or song selection.\r\n"In unsupervised machine learning," he explained, "the program looks at all the unsorted data and - without any human intervention - clusters the data into separate categories." After that sorting process, experts can then identify "these clusters as places an I.E.D. is likely to be hidden or places where an ambush is likely to occur."\r\nMichael Sick, president of Serene Software, a technology consulting firm in Jacksonville, Fla., also said he was considering submitting a proposal for funding. His research, he said, would most likely be on how to create basic computer models of intuition "that can be applied to any number of problems," including drones and video games.\r\n"There are endless applications to this type of technology," Mr. Sick said.\r\nFor the Navy, the program''s four-year timeline may be just the beginning.\r\n"If the work produces new insights into our understanding of intuition and the neural basis, then it may be expanded into a longer program," said Ms. Estabrooke of the research office, "but this is an initial effort."\r\nDon Tucker, a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon whose work is also cited in the Navy''s announcement, said the research eventually "could improve training not only in the military, but also in sports and many job settings."\r\n"Spiderman had superpowers," Mr. Tucker said. "But maybe the rest of us can learn to use the experience of the intuitive cognition we have."\r\n\r\n•\r\nMao''s Rockets and Modern War, Part III \r\n•\r\nCombat Injuries Can Change Lives in Surprising Ways \r\n•\r\nFor Soldiers, the End of the Mail Means the End of the War \r\n•\r\nStudy on ''Burn Pits'' Cites Inadequate Evidence of Health Effects \r\n•\r\nIn Iraq and Afghanistan, War-Weary Eyes Turn Toward Libya \r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: March 28, 2012\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nDOCUMENT-TYPE: News\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Web Blog\r\n', 'robbie');

The “no” votes were cast by 140 Democrats and 28 Republicans, including a number who described the measure as a potential threat to privacy and civil liberties.\r\n\r\nUnder the bill, the federal government can share classified information with private companies to help them protect their computer networks. Companies, in turn, could voluntarily share information about cyberthreats with the government and would generally be protected against lawsuits for doing so if they acted in good faith.\r\n\r\nThe White House opposed the bill, saying it could “undermine the public’s trust in the government as well as in the Internet by undermining fundamental privacy, confidentiality, civil liberties and consumer protections.”\r\n\r\nIn addition, the White House said the government should set “minimum cybersecurity performance standards” for the private sector — an approach resisted by House Republican leaders.\r\n\r\n“The White House believes the government ought to control the Internet, government ought to set standards and government ought to take care of everything that’s needed for cybersecurity,” said Speaker John A. Boehner. “They’re in a camp all by themselves.”\r\n\r\n“We can’t have the government in charge of our Internet,” Mr. Boehner added.\r\n\r\nThe Senate is working on a more comprehensive bipartisan bill that directs the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to issue regulations to protect “critical infrastructure,” including the electric power grid, water and sewer systems, transportation hubs and financial service networks.\r\n\r\nIn confidential briefings on Capitol Hill, administration officials have expressed alarm about the damage that could be done by malicious attacks on computer systems and networks that have become an indispensable part of everyday life. Supporters of the bill said China was stealing jobs by pilfering proprietary information and valuable trade secrets stored in American computers.\r\n\r\nThe House bill was written by Representatives Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the House intelligence committee, and C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the panel.\r\n\r\nThey accepted many amendments to protect privacy, but not enough to satisfy advocacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union or the Center for Democracy and Technology. The civil liberties union criticized the bill as “a privacy disaster.”\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr. Rogers said the sharing of information with the government was “all voluntary,” and he added, “There is no government surveillance, none, not any in this bill.”\r\n\r\nThe bill says that “cyber threat information” shared with the federal government by the private sector can be used for five purposes: to protect computer systems; to investigate cybersecurity crimes; to protect people from “serious bodily harm”; to protect “the national security of the United States”; and to prevent the sexual exploitation or kidnapping of children.\r\n\r\nSome members of both parties said they worried that the bill could lead to violations of privacy.\r\n\r\n“We do have a real cyberthreat in this country, and this bill is an honest attempt to deal with it,” said Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, who voted against the legislation.\r\n\r\n“But the absence of explicit privacy protections for individuals is, to me, a greater threat to democracy and liberty than the cyberthreats that face America.”\r\n\r\nThe House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said, “The threat of cyberattack is a real one, but the response must balance freedom and security.”', 'robbie');

It has been grabbing images of users'' computer screens, recording their instant messaging chats, remotely turning on their microphones to record their audio conversations and monitoring their keystrokes and network traffic, according to a report by Kaspersky Labs, a Moscow-based security research firm.\r\nIf the report''s findings prove to be true, Flame would be the third major Internet weapon to have been discovered since 2010. The first, named Stuxnet, was intended to attack software in specialized industrial equipment, and was used to destroy centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility in 2010. The second virus, called Duqu, like Flame, performed reconnaissance. Security researchers believe Duqu was created by the same group of programmers behind Stuxnet.\r\nThe researchers said Flame appeared to have been developed by a different group of programmers. It contains 20 times more code than Stuxnet and is much more widespread than Duqu. Researchers believe Duqu hit fewer than 50 targets worldwide. Kaspersky''s researchers said they had detected Flame on thousands of computers belonging to individuals, private companies and universities across the Middle East.\r\n''''Flame can easily be described as one of the most complex threats ever discovered,'''' Alexander Gostev, the head of Kaspersky''s Global Research and Analysis team, wrote in a blog post on Monday. ''''It''s big and incredibly sophisticated. It pretty much redefines the notion of cyberwar and cyberespionage.''''\r\nResearchers say they do not know who is behind the virus, but given its complexity and the geography of its targets, they said it was most likely being staged by a government. The authors of Stuxnet and Duqu are also unknown but their targets and digital evidence suggest to some researchers that they may have been part of a joint American-Israeli project to sabotage Iran''s nuclear program.\r\nKaspersky''s researchers said the majority of computers infected with Flame were located in Iran. Like Duqu and Stuxnet, Flame infects machines through a known security hole in the Windows operating software.\r\nResearchers discovered Flame while investigating reports that another computer virus, called Wiper, had been erasing computer programs in Iran. The International Telecommunications Union, a United Nations agency, had asked Kaspersky''s researchers to look into Wiper when they discovered that thousands more computers had been infected with Flame.\r\nThis is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: May 29, 2012\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper', 'robbie');

An expert at the organization said in a telephone interview that it was potentially more harmful than the 2010 Stuxnet virus, which destroyed several centrifuges used for Iran’s nuclear enrichment program. In contrast to Stuxnet, the newly identified virus is designed not to do damage but to collect information secretly from a wide variety of sources.\r\n\r\nFlame, which experts say could be as much as five years old, was discovered by Iranian computer experts. In a statement about Flame on its Web site, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian producer of antivirus software, said that “the complexity and functionality of the newly discovered malicious program exceed those of all other cyber menaces known to date.”\r\n\r\nThe virus bears special encryption hallmarks that an Iranian cyberdefense official said have strong similarities to previous Israeli malware. “Its encryption has a special pattern which you only see coming from Israel,” said Kamran Napelian, an official with Iran’s Computer Emergency Response Team. “Unfortunately, they are very powerful in the field of I.T.”\r\n\r\nWhile Israel never comments officially on such matters, its involvement was hinted at by top officials there. “Anyone who sees the Iranian threat as a significant threat — it’s reasonable that he will take various steps, including these, to harm it,” said the vice prime minister and strategic affairs minister, Moshe Yaalon, in a widely quoted interview with Israel’s Army Radio on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nIn a speech Tuesday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not mention Flame specifically, but he did include computer viruses as one of five critical types of threats Israel faces, saying: “We are investing a great deal of money in that, human capital and financial capital. I expect these investments to yield a great deal in the coming years.”\r\n\r\nMr. Napelian said that Flame seemed designed to mine data from personal computers and that it was distributed through USB sticks rather than the Internet, meaning that a USB has to be inserted manually into at least one computer in a network.\r\n\r\n“This virus copies what you enter on your keyboard; it monitors what you see on your computer screen,” Mr. Napelian said. That includes collecting passwords, recording sounds if the computer is connected to a microphone, scanning disks for specific files and monitoring Skype.\r\n\r\n“Those controlling the virus can direct it from a distance,” Mr. Napelian said. “Flame is no ordinary product. This was designed to monitor selected computers.”\r\n\r\nMr. Napelian said he was not authorized to disclose how much damage Flame had caused, but guessed the virus had been active for the past six months and was responsible for a “massive” data loss. Iran says it has developed antivirus software to combat Flame, something that international antivirus companies have yet to do, since they have just become aware of its existence.\r\n\r\n“One of the most alarming facts is that the Flame cyberattack campaign is currently in its active phase, and its operator is consistently surveilling infected systems, collecting information and targeting new systems to accomplish its unknown goals,” Alexander Gostev, chief security expert at Kaspersky Lab, said on the company’s Web site.\r\n\r\nThose close to Iran’s leaders said that the virus was tantamount to an attack.\r\n\r\n“I am no virus expert, and my computer seems to be working,” said Sadollah Zarei, a columnist for the state newspaper, Kayhan, “but I know this is covert warfare, aimed at weakening us.”\r\n\r\nJodi Rudoren contributed reporting from Tel Aviv.\r\nThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction:\r\n\r\nCorrection: May 30, 2012\r\n\r\n\r\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the contents of the message posted on the Web site of Iran’s Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center. The message said the Flame virus was dangerous, not that it was potentially more harmful than the 2010 Stuxnet virus. That observation was made by an expert from the center.      \r\n', 'robbie');

But already digital clues point to its creators and capabilities.\r\nResearchers at Kaspersky Lab, which released a report about the virus on Monday, believe Flame was written by a different group of programmers from those who created other malware directed at computers in the Middle East, particularly those in Iran. But Flame appears to be part of the state-sponsored campaign that spied on and eventually set back Iran''s nuclear program in 2010, when a digital attack destroyed roughly a fifth of Iran''s nuclear centrifuges.\r\nFlame, these researchers say, shares several notable features with two other major programs that targeted Iran in recent years: Duqu and Stuxnet. Because both were written on the same platform and share many of the same fingerprints in their source code, researchers believe both were developed by the same group of programmers. Researchers have cited intriguing bits of digital evidence that point to a joint American-Israeli effort to undermine Iran''s efforts to build a nuclear bomb.\r\nFor example, researchers at Kaspersky Lab tracked the working hours of Duqu''s operators and found they coincided with Jerusalem local time. They also noted that Duqu''s programmers were not active between sundown on Fridays and sundown on Saturdays, a time that coincides with the Sabbath when observant Jews typically refrain from secular work.\r\nIn other Flame news, the Associated Press reports that technicians had to cut off links between Iran''s oil ministry and the Internet in their efforts to contain the virus. And MSNBC looks into why the virus was written a programming language most commonly used for video games: "Why would a nation-state trying to commit secret espionage toy with video game software?"\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: June 1, 2012\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nDOCUMENT-TYPE: News\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Web Blog\r\n', 'robbie');

The United States and Chinese governments have not given any hint publicly of the discovery of the spying suspect. If the case were to be brought into the open, it could become another point of friction in a year of sharp diplomatic tensions between Washington and Beijing.\r\nEarlier this year, the Communist Party was dealing with a fragile moment in China''s relations with the United States. In February, a former Chinese police chief drove to the United States Consulate in Chengdu to present evidence linking the wife of a Politburo member, Bo Xilai, to the killing last year of a British businessman. The police chief, Wang Lijun, was escorted to Beijing by officials from the Ministry of State Security after spending a night in the consulate.\r\nOne week later, Xi Jinping, the vice president and presumed next leader of China, embarked on a prominent five-day good-will tour of the United States that had been scheduled months earlier and was hosted by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\r\nIt is unclear what kind of information the detained Chinese official is suspected of having given to the United States and whether that information has compromised any operations by the Chinese government. Recently, news of the spying suspect''s detention had been circulating quietly in some foreign intelligence circles. A spokesman for the American Embassy in Beijing declined to comment.\r\nSecretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, visiting Oslo on Friday, declined to comment on the reports of an espionage arrest, as did officials at the State Department and the White House in Washington.\r\nA senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities, said the detention came during the same period as a series of investigations begun after the revelations in the Bo affair. The investigations, authorized by China''s top leaders, have expanded beyond Mr. Bo to the Ministry of State Security and now include allegations of improper use of the security services by various Chinese officials and corruption, the official said.\r\nIt was not clear that the espionage case was related in any way to the other investigations.\r\n''''There is clearly some very intense stuff going on with the security ministry,'''' the official said. ''''It''s hard to tell exactly, but it''s clearly maneuvering going on after Bo.''''\r\nEarly this year, senior Chinese officials imposed a foreign travel ban on scholars at an important research center based in Beijing that some analysts say has ties to the Ministry of State Security. The ban on overseas travel within the center, the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, was related to an intelligence breach, said one person who has contact with the institutes'' scholars, and could well be a direct result of the discovery and detention of the official suspected of spying.\r\nThe detainee could be charged with treason and tried; the charge carries a maximum penalty of death.\r\nThe detention of the official was first reported by Chinese-language news organizations outside the mainland that sometimes dispense rumor as fact. The World Journal reported on May 27 that the suspect was the secretary of a vice minister in the Ministry of State Security.\r\nReuters reported Friday from Hong Kong that an aide to a vice minister in the Ministry of State Security was arrested between January and March this year on suspicion that he had been passing intelligence to the United States for years. Reuters cited an anonymous source who said the aide had passed on ''''political, economic and strategic intelligence.''''\r\nThe aide was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars and spoke English, Reuters said the source told it. The vice minister has been suspended and is being questioned, too.\r\nDavid Wise, the author of the 2011 book ''''Tiger Trap: America''s Secret Spy War With China,'''' said that Chinese intelligence is ''''a very hard target.''''\r\n''''If in fact the C.I.A. had a mole inside the Ministry of State Security, that would be a pretty big deal,'''' Mr. Wise said. ''''It would open a window on Chinese intelligence operations worldwide, and first of all what they''re doing against the U.S. We might be able to identify their operatives and find out what the Chinese government role is in cyberwarfare, which has never been proven.''''\r\nThe last time a prominent turning of a Chinese official by the United States became public was in 1985, when Yu Qiangsheng, a senior security official, defected and revealed that a former employee of the C.I.A., Larry Wu-Tai Chin, had been selling secrets to the Chinese. Mr. Chin killed himself in prison while awaiting sentencing.\r\nThere have been sharp twists in diplomatic relations between the United States and China this year. Just two months after Mr. Wang, the police chief, showed up at the American Consulate, a persecuted Chinese activist and self-trained lawyer, Chen Guangcheng, escaped from guards keeping him under house arrest in his village and reached the American Embassy in Beijing. Mr. Chen was brought into the embassy right before a round of talks known as the Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the two nations, and diplomats from each country negotiated hastily to resolve his fate. Last month, Mr. Chen flew to the United States with his family to start a fellowship at New York University School of Law.\r\nMrs. Clinton, referring to the diplomatic crisis over Mr. Chen, said in Oslo on Friday that although the United States and China often disagreed, they had many mutual interests and that President Obama''s administration was determined to cultivate cooperative relations on a host of economic and security issues.\r\n''''The goal for our relationship with China is to ensure that we defy history,'''' Mrs. Clinton said. ''''It has never happened that an established pre-eminent power and a rising power have been able to find a way to not only coexist, but cooperate. We intend to make history with our relationship with China.''''\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: June 2, 2012\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper', 'robbie');

Cyberwar is coming. Although the long-announced, long-awaited computer-based conflict has yet to occur, the forecast grows more ominous with every telling: an onslaught is brought by a warring nation, backed by its brains and computing resources; banks and other businesses in the enemy states are destroyed; governments grind to a halt; telephones disconnect; the microchip-controlled Tickle Me Elmos will be transformed into unstoppable killing machines.\r\nNo, that last item is not part of the scenario, mostly because those microprocessor-controlled toys aren''t connected to the Internet through the industrial remote-control technologies known as Scada systems, for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition. The technology allows remote monitoring and control of operations like manufacturing production lines and civil works projects like dams. So security experts envision terrorists at a keyboard remotely shutting down factory floors or opening a dam''s floodgates to devastate cities downstream.\r\nBut how bad would a cyberwar really be -- especially when compared with the blood-and-guts genuine article? And is there really a chance it would happen at all?\r\nWhatever the answer, governments are readying themselves for the Big One.\r\nChina, security experts believe, has long probed United States networks. According to a 2007 Defense Department annual report to Congress, China''s military has invested heavily in electronic countermeasures and defenses against attack, and concepts like ''''computer network attack, computer network defense and computer network exploitation.''''\r\nAccording to the report, the Chinese Army sees computer network operations ''''as critical to achieving ''electromagnetic dominance'' '''' -- whatever that is -- early in a conflict.\r\nThe United States is arming up, as well. Robert Elder, commander of the Air Force Cyberspace Command, told reporters in Washington at a recent breakfast that his newly formed command, which defends military data, communications and control networks, is learning how to disable an opponent''s computer networks and crash its databases.\r\n''''We want to go in and knock them out in the first round,'''' he said, as reported on Military.com.\r\nAn all-out cyberconflict could ''''could have huge impacts,'''' said Danny McPherson, an expert with Arbor Networks. Hacking into industrial control systems, he said, could be ''''a very real threat.''''\r\nAttacks on the Internet itself, say, through what are known as root-name servers, which play a role in connecting Internet users with Web sites, could cause widespread problems, said Paul Kurtz, the chief operating officer of Safe Harbor, a security consultancy. And having so many nations with a finger on the digital button, of course, raises the prospect of a cyberconflict caused by a misidentified attacker or a simple glitch.\r\nStill, instead of thinking in terms of the industry''s repeated warnings of a ''''digital Pearl Harbor,'''' Mr. McPherson said, ''''I think cyberwarfare will be far more subtle,'''' in that ''''certain parts of the system won''t work, or it will be that we can''t trust information we''re looking at.''''\r\nWhatever form cyberwar might take, most experts have concluded that what happened in Estonia earlier this month was not an example.\r\nThe cyberattacks in Estonia were apparently sparked by tensions over the country''s plan to remove Soviet-era war memorials. Estonian officials initially blamed Russia for the attacks, suggesting that its state-run computer networks blocked online access to banks and government offices.\r\nThe Kremlin denied the accusations. And Estonian officials ultimately accepted the idea that perhaps this attack was the work of tech-savvy activists, or ''''hactivists,'''' who have been mounting similar attacks against just about everyone for several years.\r\nStill, many in the security community and the news media initially treated the digital attacks against Estonia''s computer networks as the coming of a long-anticipated new chapter in the history of conflict -- when, in fact, the technologies and techniques used in the attacks were hardly new, nor were they the kind of thing that only a powerful government would have in its digital armamentarium.\r\nThe force of the attack appears to have come from armies of ''''zombie'''' computers infected with software that makes them available for manipulation and remote command. These ''''bot-nets'''' are more commonly used for illicit activities like committing online fraud and sending spam, said James Andrew Lewis, director of the Technology and Public Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\r\nThe main method of attack in Estonia -- through what is known as a digital denial of service -- doesn''t disable computers from within, but simply stacks up so much digital debris at the entryway that legitimate visitors, like bank customers, can''t get in.\r\nThat is not the same as disabling a computer from the inside, Mr. Lewis stressed. ''''The idea that Estonia was brought to its knees -- that''s when we have to stop sniffing glue,'''' he said.\r\nIn fact, an attack would have borne real risks for Russia, or any aggressor nation, said Ross Stapleton-Gray, a security consultant in Berkeley, Calif. ''''The downside consequence of getting caught doing something more could well be a military escalation,'''' he said.\r\nThat''s too great a risk for a government to want to engage in what amounts to high-tech harassment, Mr. Lewis said. ''''The Russians are not dumb,'''' he said.\r\nEven if an Internet-based conflict does eventually break out, and the dueling microchips do their worst, it would have a fundamentally different effect from flesh-and-blood fighting, said Andrew MacPherson, research assistant professor of justice studies at the University of New Hampshire. ''''If you have a porcelain vase and drop it -- it''s very difficult to put it back together,'''' he said. ''''A cyberattack, maybe it''s more like a sheet that can be torn and it can be sewed back together.''''\r\nThat is why Kevin Poulsen, a writer on security issues at Wired News, said that he had difficulty envisioning the threat that others see from an overseas attack by electrons and photons alone. ''''They unleash their deadly viruses and then they land on the beaches and sweep across our country without resistance because we''re rebooting our P.C.''s?'''' he asked.\r\nIn fact, the United States has prepared for cyberattacks incidentally, through our day-to-day exposure to crashes, glitches, viruses and meltdowns. There are very few places where a computer is so central that everything crashes to a halt if the machine goes on the blink.\r\nRussian space engineers struggled to fix crashing computers aboard the International Space Station that help keep the orbiting laboratory oriented properly in space -- if they hadn''t been fixed, the station might have had to be abandoned, at least temporarily.\r\nDown on earth, by comparison, this correspondent found himself near the Kennedy Space Center in a convenience store without cash and with the credit card network unavailable. ''''The satellite''s down,'''' the clerk said. ''''It''s the rain.'''' And so the purchase of jerky and soda had to wait. At the center''s visitor complex, a sales clerk dealt with the same problem by pulling out paper sales slips.\r\nPeople, after all, are not computers. When something goes wrong, we do not crash. Instead, we find another way: we improvise; we fix. We pull out the slips.', 'domenic');

KRAMER and NICOLE PERLROTH; Andrew E. Kramer reported from Moscow and Nicole Perlroth from San Francisco.\r\n\r\nSECTION: Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1\r\n\r\nLENGTH: 1498 words\r\n\r\nMOSCOW -- When Eugene Kaspersky, the founder of Europe''s largest antivirus company, discovered the Flame virus that is afflicting computers in Iran and the Middle East, he recognized it as a technologically sophisticated virus that only a government could create.\r\nHe also recognized that the virus, which he compares to the Stuxnet virus built by programmers employed by the United States and Israel, adds weight to his warnings of the grave dangers posed by governments that manufacture and release viruses on the Internet.\r\n''''Cyberweapons are the most dangerous innovation of this century,'''' he told a gathering of technology company executives, called the CeBIT conference, last month in Sydney, Australia. While the United States and Israel are using the weapons to slow the nuclear bomb-making abilities of Iran, they could also be used to disrupt power grids and financial systems or even wreak havoc with military defenses.\r\nComputer security companies have for years used their discovery of a new virus or worm to call attention to themselves and win more business from companies seeking computer protection. Mr. Kaspersky, a Russian computer security expert, and his company, Kaspersky Lab, are no different in that regard. But he is also using his company''s integral role in exposing or decrypting three computer viruses apparently intended to slow or halt Iran''s nuclear program to argue for an international treaty banning computer warfare.\r\nA growing array of nations and other entities are using online weapons, he says, because they are ''''thousands of times cheaper'''' than conventional armaments.\r\nWhile antivirus companies might catch some, he says, only an international treaty that would ban militaries and spy agencies from making viruses will truly solve the problem.\r\nThe wide disclosure of the details of the Flame virus by Kaspersky Lab also seems intended to promote the Russian call for a ban on cyberweapons like those that blocked poison gas or expanding bullets from the armies of major nations and other entities.\r\nAnd that puts the Russian company in a difficult position because it already faces suspicions that it is tied to the Russian government, accusations Mr. Kaspersky has constantly denied as he has built his business.\r\nWhile Russian officials have not commented on the discovery of Flame, the Russian minister of telecommunications gave a speech, also in May, calling for an international cyberweapon ban. Russia has also pushed for a bilateral treaty with the United States.\r\nThe United States has agreed to discuss such a disarmament treaty with the Russians, but has also tried to encourage Russia to prosecute online crime, which flourishes in this country.\r\nThe United States has long objected to the Russian crusade for an online arms control ban. ''''There is no broad international support for a cyberweapon ban,'''' says James A. Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''''This is a global diplomatic ploy by the Russians to take down a perceived area of U.S. military advantage.''''\r\nRussia, many security experts note, has been accused of using cyberwarfare in disputes with Estonia and wars in Georgia.\r\nMr. Kaspersky said that at no point did he cooperate with the Federal Security Agency, the successor agency to the K.G.B., as the Flame virus was not a threat to Russian citizens.\r\nKaspersky Lab, he said, felt justified exposing the Flame virus because the company was working under the auspices of a United Nations agency. But the company has been noticeably silent on viruses perpetrated in its own backyard, where Russian-speaking criminal syndicates controlled a third of the estimated $12 billion global cybercrime market last year, according to the Russian security firm Group-IB.\r\nSome say there is good reason. ''''He''s got family,'''' said Sean Sullivan, an adviser at F-Secure, a computer security firm in Helsinki. ''''I wouldn''t expect them to be the most aggressive about publicizing threats in their neighborhood for fear those neighbors would retaliate.''''\r\nLast year, Mr. Kaspersky''s 19-year-old son was kidnapped by criminals demanding a ransom. The kidnappers did not appear to have ties to any of Russia''s online criminal syndicates, but Mr. Sullivan says, ''''It was probably a wake-up call.''''\r\nSome computer security firms say Mr. Kaspersky''s researchers have hyped Flame. It is too early, his critics say, to call the virus a ''''cyberweapon'''' and to suggest it was sponsored by a state.\r\nJoe Jaroch, a vice president at Webroot, an antivirus maker, says he first encountered a sample of Flame in 2007. He says he did not publicize the discovery because he did not consider the code sophisticated. ''''There are many more dangerous viruses out there,'''' he said. ''''I would be shocked if this was the work of a nation state.''''\r\nMr. Sullivan, from F-Secure, said: ''''It''s interesting and complex, but not sleek and stealthy. It could be the work of a military contractor -- Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and other contractors are developing programs like these for different intelligence services. To call it a cyberweapon says more about Kaspersky''s cold war mentality than anything else. It has to be taken with a grain of salt.''''\r\nWhether the skepticism is authentic or professional jealousy, no one doubts the Kaspersky Lab''s skills. Mr. Kaspersky studied cryptography at a high school that was co-sponsored by the K.G.B. and Russia''s ministry of defense, and later took a job with the Russian military. He started tracking computer viruses as a side project in 1989, after his work PC was infected with one. In 1997, he co-founded Kaspersky Lab with his wife at the time, Natalya, in their Moscow apartment.\r\nThe headquarters of the team that unraveled Flame is an open-plan office of cubicles overlooking a park on the edge of Moscow. Mr. Kaspersky eschews suits and his researchers wear Converse shoes and tattered jeans, much as their counterparts in the United States do. A Darth Vader mask adorns one desk.\r\nTalent also abounds. The Belarussian virus hunter who first found the Stuxnet virus in 2010, Sergei Ulasen, now works for Kaspersky Lab.\r\nToday, the company is one of Russia''s most recognizable exports. It commands 8 percent of the world''s software security market for businesses, with revenue reaching $612 million last year.\r\nYet Mr. Kaspersky says he often has to dispute suggested ties to Russia''s security services. Analysts say suspicions about the firm''s Russian roots have hindered its expansion abroad.\r\n''''The U.S. government, defense contractors and lots of U.S. companies won''t work with them,'''' said Peter Firstbrook, director of malware research at Gartner, a research firm. ''''There''s no evidence that they have any back doors in their software or any ties to the Russian mafia or state. It''s a red herring, but there is still a concern that you can''t operate in Russia without being controlled by the ruling party.''''\r\nMr. Kaspersky said his company tackled Flame upon the request of the International Telecommunication Union, an agency of the United Nations. He assigned about three dozen engineers to investigate a virus that was erasing files on computers at Iran''s oil ministry. Kaspersky researchers, some of whom had analyzed suspected United States and Israeli viruses that destroyed centrifuges in Iran''s nuclear program two years earlier, were already following up on complaints from Iranian clients that Kaspersky''s antivirus software was not catching a new type of malware on their systems, Kaspersky officials said.\r\n''''We saw an unusual structure of the code, compressed and encrypted in several ways,'''' Vitaly Kamlyuk, a researcher on the team that cracked the virus.\r\nIt was the first virus to look for Bluetooth-enabled devices in the vicinity, either to spread to those devices, map a user''s social or professional circle, or steal information from them. The program also contained a command called ''''microbe'''' that silently turned on users'' microphones to record their conversations and sent audio files back to the attackers. It was clearly not a virus made by criminals.\r\n''''Antivirus companies are in a not easy situation,'''' Mr. Kaspersky said. ''''We have to protect our customers everywhere in the world. On the other hand, we understand there are quite serious powers behind these viruses.''''\r\nEven though finding viruses first is usually a boon for antivirus companies, cracking Flame, Mr. Kaspersky said, might hurt his business in one regard.

The potential use of such technologies offensively has been widely discussed in recent years, and disruptions of communications systems and Web sites have become a standard occurrence in both political and military conflicts since 2000.\r\nThe report, titled ''''Technology, Policy, Law, and Ethics Regarding U.S. Acquisition and Use of Cyberattack Capabilities,'''' concludes that the veil of secrecy that has surrounded cyberwar planning is detrimental to the country''s military policy.\r\nThe report''s authors include Adm. William A. Owens, a former vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff; William O. Studeman, former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency; and Walter B. Slocombe, former under secretary of defense for policy. Scientists and cyberspecialists on the panel included Richard L. Garwin, an I.B.M. physicist.\r\nAdmiral Owens said at a news conference Wednesday in Washington that the notion of ''''enduring unilateral dominance in cyberspace'''' by the United States was not realistic in part because of the low cost of the technologies required to mount attacks. He also said the idea that offensive attacks were ''''nonrisky'''' military options was not correct.\r\nIn the United States, the offensive use of cyberweapons is a highly classified military secret. There have been reports going back to the 1990s that American intelligence agencies have mounted operations in which electronic gear was systematically modified to disrupt the activities of an opponent or for surveillance purposes. But these activities have not been publicly acknowledged by the government.\r\nThe report concludes that the United States should create a public national policy regarding cyberattacks based on an open debate on the issues. The authors also call on the United States to find common ground with other nations on cyberattacks to avoid future military crises.\r\nThe authors point to a 2004 Pentagon statement on military doctrine, indicating that the United States might respond to a cyberattack with the military use of nuclear weapons in certain cases. ''''For example,'''' the Pentagon National Military Strategy statement says, ''''cyberattacks on U.S. commercial information systems or attacks against transportation networks may have a greater economic or psychological effect than a relatively small release of a lethal agent.''''\r\nPentagon and military officials confirmed that the United States reserved the option to respond in any way it chooses to punish an adversary responsible for a catastrophic cyberattack. While the options could include the use of nuclear weapons, officials said, such an extreme counterattack was hardly the most likely response.\r\n''''The United States reserves the right to respond to intrusions into government, military and national infrastructure information systems and networks by nations, terrorist groups or other adversaries in a manner it deems appropriate,'''' said one senior Pentagon official.\r\nAnother senior Pentagon official added, ''''While the United States would always reserve the right to respond appropriately to defend the nation and its citizens, this kind of scenario is extremely speculative and requires an enormously vivid imagination.''''\r\nThe two officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the highly classified nature of planning for cyberwarfare and nuclear warfare. Both officials emphasized that in American military planning, there are only rare instances when any specific option would be declared off-limits in advance.\r\nThis effort to specifically project a lack of clarity is viewed as important to keeping an adversary uncertain of the severity of an American counterattack. Introducing that uncertainty into the thinking of an adversary''s government and military has historically been an essential element of deterrence, whether traditional nuclear deterrence or today''s cyberwar planning.\r\nFor example, during the cold war, when the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies stationed an overwhelming conventional force in Central Europe, American planners were never certain that NATO''s tanks and artillery could hold back the Soviet-led armor if an offensive was begun across the Fulda Gap in Germany.\r\nThus, the United States never declared that it would be bound to respond to a Soviet and Warsaw Pact conventional invasion with only American and NATO conventional forces. The fear of escalating to a nuclear conflict was viewed as a pillar of stability and is credited with helping deter the larger Soviet-led conventional force throughout the cold war.\r\nIntroducing the possibility of a nuclear response to a catastrophic cyberattack would be expected to serve the same purpose.', 'domenic');

Sanger\r\nIllustrated. 476 pages. Crown Publishers. $28.\r\nIs the United States at war with Iran? If David Sanger''s account in his new book, ''''Confront and Conceal,'''' on President Obama''s foreign policy, is to be believed -- and I find it very believable -- we certainly are.\r\nThe stunning revelations by Mr. Sanger, The New York Times''s chief Washington correspondent, about the American role in using computer warfare to attack Iran''s nuclear program already have made headlines, and rightly so. He persuasively shows that under Mr. Obama, the United States government has been engaged in what one presidential adviser calls ''''a state of low-grade, daily conflict.''''\r\nThe heart of this book is the chapter titled ''''Olympic Games,'''' which Mr. Sanger writes is the code name for a joint program of Israel and the United States to insert malicious software into the machinery of the Iranian military-industrial complex and so set back Iran''s ability to manufacture weapons-grade uranium. Specifically, in 2008 and 2009 the software threw off the balance of centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear enrichment center. It did so in a variety of unpredictable ways, making it at first seem like the problems were random or the result of Iranian incompetence. The key to getting inside the computers -- which were not connected to the Internet -- was to load the virus into thumb drives that Iranian nuclear technicians, perhaps unknowingly, would bring to work and plug into the computer systems there.\r\nIn one of the most impressive steps in the cybercampaign, the inserted software recorded the operation of the centrifuges. Then, as the computer worm took control of the machines and began destroying them, the software played back the signals of the normal operation of the centrifuges. ''''The plant operators were clueless,'''' Mr. Sanger writes. ''''There were no warning lights, no alarm bells, no dials gyrating wildly. But anyone down in the plant would have felt, and heard, that the centrifuges were suddenly going haywire. First came a rumble, then an explosion.'''' This is an account that long will be consulted by anyone trying to understand not just Iran but warfare in the 21st century. It alone is worth the price of the book.\r\nAnd that is a good thing, because the rest of the book -- overviews of Mr. Obama''s handling of Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Arab Spring, and China and North Korea -- offers a solid but rather dutiful summary of this administration''s foreign policy. As I read it, I wondered if the author -- in the course of working on a book to be titled something like ''''The Education of a President'''' -- had come across the extraordinary material on the cyberwar against Iran.\r\nThose other spinach-laden sections are not bad, but they are not as compelling as Mr. Sanger''s guided tour of the anti-Iranian operations. He offers a healthy meditation on Mr. Obama''s heavy use of drone strikes in Pakistan, asking how such strikes differ from a program of targeted assassination, if at all. And throughout, Mr. Sanger clearly has enjoyed great access to senior White House officials, most notably to Thomas Donilon, the national security adviser.\r\nMr. Donilon, in effect, is the hero of the book, as well as the commenter of record on events. He leads the team that goes to Israel and spends ''''five hours wading through the intelligence in the basement of the prime minister''s residence.'''' He is shown studying the nettlesome problems of foreign relations, working closely with the president, and fending off the villains of this story -- which in Mr. Sanger''s account tend to be the government of Pakistan and, surprisingly, the generals of the American military. ''''We fought the Pentagon every step of the way on this,'''' a ''''senior American diplomat'''' tells Mr. Sanger. At another point, a ''''senior White House official'''' reports that, ''''There was incredible resistance inside the Pentagon.'''' And so on.\r\nThe virtue of this book -- its foundation of White House sources who give the author insiders'' material like a transcript of Mr. Obama''s last telephone call with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak -- is also its weakness. That is, Mr. Sanger shows us the world through the eyes of Mr. Obama, Mr. Donilon and those around him. But he also tends to depict Washington and the world as they see it. The perceptions of White House officials, especially in the first year of the Obama presidency, which saw a steep learning curve for the president and those around him, are not always dispositive.\r\nWhen, for example, the White House moved closer to the Pentagon''s hawkish view of North Korea, ''''We had people in the Pentagon telling us, ''We told you so,'' '''' a senior administration official informs Mr. Sanger. That official adds, rather snidely, that ''''perhaps they were making a case for not cutting the budget'''' of the Pentagon.\r\nMr. Sanger''s sure touch in discussing foreign policy falters when he addresses the Pentagon. He incorrectly states that ''''battlespace'''' is a term of cyberwar, when it actually is United States military jargon for any sort of battlefield, conventional or not. More important, Mr. Sanger seems unaware that a large number of military officers agreed with President Obama that Iraq was a ''''war of choice,'''' and a huge mistake.\r\nNor by the time Mr. Obama took office was ''''much of the military ... running on autopilot.'''' Rather, after five years of sweating and bleeding in Iraq and Afghanistan, the military was engaged in a good deal of soul-searching about those wars. The ''''surge'''' in Iraq was largely the product of military dissidents who believed that invading Iraq had been a mistake.\r\nThese are minor blemishes in an important book. I raise them mainly because of the warning signal they send about civil-military relations under President Obama. White House mistrust and suspicion of generals is not a recipe for an effective use of military force because it impedes the candid sort of discussion that consciously brings to the surface differences, examines assumptions and hammers out sustainable strategies.\r\nRather, it suggests that Mr. Obama and those around him are repeating some of the dysfunctionality that characterized the dealings of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson with the Pentagon during the descent into the Vietnam War. With Syria hanging fire, a nuclear-armed Pakistan on the brink and the Afghan war dragging on, that is not a reassuring state of affairs.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: June 6, 2012\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: PHOTOS: PHOTO(C1)\r\nPresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, center, at Iran''s nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz.

Search for ''''women'''' in Persian and you''re told, ''''Dear Subscriber, access to this site is not possible.''''\r\nLast July, on popular sites that offer free downloads of various software, an escape hatch appeared. The computer program allowed Iranian Internet users to evade government censorship.\r\nCollege students discovered the key first, then spread it through e-mail messages and file-sharing. By late autumn more than 400,000 Iranians were surfing the uncensored Web.\r\nThe software was created not by Iranians, but by Chinese computer experts volunteering for the Falun Gong, a spiritual movement that has beem suppressed by the Chinese government since 1999. They maintain a series of computers in data centers around the world to route Web users'' requests around censors'' firewalls.\r\nThe Internet is no longer just an essential channel for commerce, entertainment and information. It has also become a stage for state control -- and rebellion against it. Computers are becoming more crucial in global conflicts, not only in spying and military action, but also in determining what information reaches people around the globe.\r\nMore than 20 countries now use increasingly sophisticated blocking and filtering systems for Internet content, according to Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based group that encourages freedom of the press.\r\nAlthough the most aggressive filtering systems have been erected by authoritarian governments like those in Iran, China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Syria, some Western democracies are also beginning to filter some content, including child pornography and other sexually oriented material.\r\nIn response, a disparate alliance of political and religious activists, civil libertarians, Internet entrepreneurs, diplomats and even military officers and intelligence agents are now challenging growing Internet censorship.\r\nThe creators of the software seized upon by Iranians are members of the Global Internet Freedom Consortium, based largely in the United States and closely affiliated with Falun Gong. The consortium is one of many small groups developing systems to make it possible for anyone to reach the open Internet. It is the modern equivalent of efforts by organizations like the Voice of America to reach the citizens of closed countries.\r\nSeparately, the Tor Project, a nonprofit group of anticensorship activists, freely offers software that can be used to send messages secretly or to reach blocked Web sites. Its software, first developed at the United States Naval Research Laboratories, is now used by more than 300,000 people globally, from the police to criminals, as well as diplomats and spies.\r\nPolitical scientists at the University of Toronto have built yet another system, called Psiphon, that allows anyone to evade national Internet firewalls using only a Web browser. Sensing a business opportunity, they have created a company to profit by making it possible for media companies to deliver digital content to Web users behind national firewalls.\r\nThe danger in this quiet electronic war is driven home by a stark warning on the group''s Web site: ''''Bypassing censorship may violate law. Serious thought should be given to the risks involved and potential consequences.''''\r\nIn this cat-and-mouse game, the cat is fighting back. The Chinese system, which opponents call the Great Firewall of China, is built in part with Western technologies. A study published in February by Rebecca MacKinnon, who teaches journalism at the University of Hong Kong, determined that much blog censorship is performed not by the government but by private Internet service providers, including companies like Yahoo China, Microsoft and MySpace. One-third to more than half of all postings made to three Chinese Internet service providers were not published or were censored, she reported.\r\nWhen the Falun Gong tried to support its service with advertising several years ago, American companies backed out under pressure from the Chinese government, members said.\r\nIn addition, the Chinese government now employs more than 40,000 people as censors at dozens of regional centers, and hundreds of thousands of students are paid to flood the Internet with government messages and crowd out dissenters.\r\nThis is not to say that China blocks access to most Internet sites; most of the material on the global Internet is available to Chinese without censorship. The government''s censors mostly censor groups deemed to be state enemies, like the Falun Gong, making it harder for them to reach potential members.\r\nBlocking such groups has become more insidious as Internet filtering technology has grown more sophisticated. As with George Orwell''s ''''Newspeak,'''' the language in ''''1984'''' that got smaller each year, governments can block particular words or phrases without users realizing their Internet searches are being censored.\r\nThose who back the ragtag opponents of censorship criticize the government-run systems as the digital equivalent of the Berlin Wall.\r\nThey also see the anticensorship efforts as a powerful political lever. ''''What is our leverage toward a country like Iran? Very little,'''' said Michael Horowitz, a fellow at the Hudson Institute who advises the Global Internet Freedom Consortium. ''''Suppose we have the capacity to make it possible for the president of the United States at will to communicate with hundreds of thousands of Iranians at no risk or limited risk? It just changes the world.''''\r\nThe United States government and the Voice of America have financed some circumvention technology efforts. But until now the Falun Gong has devoted the most resources, experts said, erecting a system that allows the largest number of Internet users open, uncensored access.\r\nEach week, Chinese Internet users receive 10 million e-mail messages and 70 million instant messages from the consortium. But unlike spam that takes you to Nigerian banking scams or offers deals on drugs like Viagra, these messages offer software to bypass the elaborate government system that blocks access to the Web sites of opposition groups like the Falun Gong.\r\nShiyu Zhou, a computer scientist, is a founder of the Falun Gong''s consortium. His cyber-war with China began in Tiananmen Square in 1989. A college student and the son of a former general in the intelligence section of the People''s Liberation Army, he said he first understood the power of government-controlled media when overnight the nation''s student protesters were transformed from heroes to killers.\r\n''''I was so disappointed,'''' he said. ''''People believed the government, they didn''t believe us.''''\r\nHe decided to leave China and study computer science in graduate school in the United States. In the late 1990s he turned to the study of Falun Gong and then joined with a small group of technically sophisticated members of the spiritual group intent on transmitting millions of e-mail messages to Chinese.\r\nBoth he and Peter Yuan Li, another early consortium volunteer, had attended Tsinghua University -- China''s Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr. Li, the son of farmers, also came to the United States to study computer science, then joined Bell Laboratories before becoming a full-time volunteer.\r\nThe risks of building circumvention tools became clear in April 2006 when, Mr. Li later told law enforcement officials, four men invaded his home in suburban Atlanta, covered his head, beat him, searched his files and stole two laptop computers. The F.B.I. has made no arrests in the case and declined to comment. But Mr. Li thinks China sent the invaders.\r\nEarly on, the group of dissidents here had some financial backing from the International Broadcasting Bureau of the Voice of America for sending e-mail messages, but the group insists that most of its effort has been based on volunteer labor and contributions.\r\nThe consortium''s circumvention system works this way: Government censorship systems like the Great Firewall can block access to certain Internet Protocol addresses. The equivalent of phone numbers, these addresses are quartets of numbers like 209.85.171.100 that identify a Web site, in this case, google.com. By clicking on a link provided in the consortium''s e-mail message, someone in China or Iran trying to reach a forbidden Web site can download software that connects to a computer abroad that then redirects the request to the site''s forbidden address.\r\nThe technique works like a basketball bank shot -- with the remote computer as the backboard and the desired Web site as the basket. But government systems hunt for and then shut off such alternative routes using a variety of increasingly sophisticated techniques. So the software keeps changing the Internet address of the remote computer -- more than once a second. By the time the censors identify an address, the system has already changed it.\r\nChina acknowledges that it monitors content on the Internet, but claims to have an agenda much like that of any other country: policing for harmful material, pornography, treasonous propaganda, criminal activity, fraud. The government says Falun Gong is a dangerous cult that has ruined the lives of thousands of people.\r\nHoping to step up its circumvention efforts, the Falun Gong last year organized extensive lobbying in Congress, which approved $15 million for circumvention services.\r\nBut the money was awarded not to the Falun Gong consortium but to Internews, an international organization that supports local media groups.\r\nThis year, a broader coalition is organizing to push for more Congressional financing of anti-filtering efforts. Negotiations are under way to bring together dissidents of Vietnam, Iran, the Uighur minority of China, Tibet, Myanmar, Cuba, Cambodia, Laos, as well as the Falun Gong, to lobby Congress for the financing.\r\nMr. Horowitz argues that $25 million could expand peak usage to as many as 45 million daily Internet users, allowing the systems to reach as many as 10 percent of the Web users in both China and Iran.\r\nMr. Zhou says his group''s financing is money well spent. ''''The entire battle over the Internet has boiled down to a battle over resources,'''' he said. ''''For every dollar we spend, China has to spend a hundred, maybe hundreds of dollars.''''\r\nAs for the Falun Gong software, it proved a little too popular among Iranians. By the end of last year the consortium''s computers were overwhelmed. On Jan. 1, the consortium had to do some blocking of its own: It shut down the service for all countries except China.\r\nCyberwar: Computers, indispensable in peace, are becoming ever more important in political conflicts and open warfare.

BRISBANE\r\n\r\nSECTION: Section SR; Column 0; Sunday Review Desk; THE PUBLIC EDITOR; Pg. 12\r\n\r\nLENGTH: 1117 words\r\n\r\nON May 29, a New York Times article depicted President Obama as deciding case by case on secret drone-strike assassinations, personally poring over photos of prospective targets.\r\nJust three days later, a second article pulled the veil on the secret American cyberweapons program, providing a close narrative of how the president personally greenlighted the expansion of efforts to use computer code to destroy Iranian nuclear enrichment machines.\r\nThe articles spawned an angry response in Congress, with some denouncing election-season leaks that they said could harm national security and others, including Senator John Kerry, complaining about The Times''s decision to publish the secrets.\r\nThe national security complaints centered on the cyberwarfare article. Written by David E. Sanger, The Times''s chief Washington correspondent, the article recounted the origins of an effort, begun under President George W. Bush, to halt the Iranian nuclear program.\r\nThe article spelled out how American programmers wrote a computer code that penetrated Iranian computers and traced a blueprint of Iran''s Natanz enrichment center. It told how the United States next worked with Israel to create a virus designed to sabotage the centrifuges used for fuel enrichment.\r\nThe narrative told how, because of a programming error, the virus broke out onto the Internet, where its existence became known though its purpose remained obscure.\r\nThe president, faced with a decision whether to continue, ordered the cyberattacks to go on and, as Mr. Sanger reported, ''''Within a week, another version of the bug brought down just under 1,000 centrifuges.'''' Finally, in its concluding paragraphs, the article said the cyberattacks were not limited to Iran.\r\nAll these details exposed a shadowy American weapon to public view and debate. Senator Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview that he worried that publication of such detailed information created perils outweighing Americans'' need for the specifics. ''''It tips people off to methods and locations and concepts and capacities,'''' he said.\r\nHe added: ''''I am not an editor, and I am not going to venture there. I have too much respect for David Sanger. I would have probably been very hard put. I just think that you have to weigh -- that is the job of an editor, of a publisher -- to weigh the impact of what you print, of how you do it and when you do it.''''\r\nTimes editors said they did weigh these considerations and followed what has become a familiar protocol, contacting government officials to determine whether there were objections on national security grounds.\r\nIn this case, the officials did not object to the articles as a whole, but certain technical details were edited out of the cyberattack article at their request, said Jill Abramson, the executive editor.\r\nExplaining the rationale The Times used to decide whether to publish the cyberwarfare and drone-strike articles, she said, ''''I think the test is: These are modes of a kind of warfare being waged in the name of the American public, and the public benefits from knowing the dimensions and some of the details of those programs, although I would hardly argue they have to have all the details.''''\r\nFor guidance in such decisions, Ms. Abramson said she refers to two documents produced by Times editors, both related to the Pentagon Papers case.\r\nOne is an Op-Ed column written in 1972 by A. M. Rosenthal, then the managing editor, who asserted one year after the case that publication of the Pentagon Papers had served the public well and had led to no national security setbacks.\r\nThe other is an affidavit by Max Frankel, then the Washington bureau chief, submitted in court in support of publishing the secret documents. It is a canny discussion of how democracy is well-served by the ecosystem of reporters and government officials trafficking in secrets while taking care to protect the nation''s core security interests.\r\nMs. Abramson added, ''''No story about details of government secrets has come near to demonstrably hurting the national security in decades and decades.''''\r\nBut that has not stopped responsible people from worrying that it will happen. Representative Peter King, a Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, told me he saw ''''no purpose'''' in publishing so many details about the cyberattacks. More broadly, though, he was clearly exasperated by the prodigious leaking of sensitive government information that enabled The Times to produce insider accounts of the drone program and cyberweapons. In his view, the leakers were motivated to show President Obama as ''''a powerful leader,'''' adding, ''''It seems to me that the reporters'' end of the deal was to go along with that.''''\r\nThe Times dismissed the notion that it was manipulated by its sources, or that the stories were dropped in the newspaper''s lap. Mr. Sanger said he began work 18 months ago, after the computer virus broke out onto the Internet and became known as Stuxnet. ''''I built this story from the bottom up,'''' he said. ''''I did this on multiple continents. It would be foolish to think all my sources are American.''''\r\nThe article, adapted from Mr. Sanger''s book ''''Confront and Conceal: Obama''s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power,'''' was published just days ahead of the book''s release date, which was set a year earlier, he said.\r\nThe article on drone strikes, meanwhile, grew out of an election coverage assignment, months in the making, that set out to explain President Obama''s national security policies that had ''''surprised the country and surprised us journalists by hewing to policies that were similar to Bush''s in some cases,'''' Ms. Abramson said.\r\nAs I view all this, I conclude that Max Frankel''s Washington ecosystem produces rough truth, perhaps the best that can be achieved at a time when the nation''s most essential policies and programs are cloaked in secrecy and reporters have to scrounge in the dark for information.\r\nThe two articles tell the public what its government is up to. Did the coverage gild the president-as-decider? Probably. The drones article cited his intellectual devotion to St. Augustine and the priestly qualities of his counterterrorism adviser: that seemed a bit much. Did the cyberweapons article deliver more detail than was necessary about the virus? Possibly.

It is a record that has heartened security hawks while drawing criticism from advocates for whistle-blowing. But a closer look reveals a surprising conclusion: the crackdown has nothing to do with any directive from the president, even though he is now promoting his record as a political asset.\r\nInstead, it was unplanned, resulting from several leftover investigations from the Bush administration, a proliferation of e-mail and computer audit trails that increasingly can pinpoint reporters'' sources, bipartisan support in Congress for a tougher approach, and a push by the director of national intelligence in 2009 that sharpened the system for tracking disclosures.\r\nEven Mr. Obama''s attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., whose Justice Department has pursued five of the six cases, was surprised by news reports pointing out that the number of cases was unprecedented, colleagues said. He has told associates that he has no desire for leak prosecutions to be his legacy.\r\n''''When we took office in January 2009, I don''t think bringing a lot of leak cases was high on anyone''s agenda,'''' said Matthew Miller, who was director of public affairs at the Justice Department until July. ''''But then they came up one by one, and without anyone realizing it, we had set a record.''''\r\nThis month Mr. Holder directed two United States attorneys to take charge of investigating the latest disclosures, on drone strikes, cyberwar and a foiled airliner plot by Al Qaeda''s branch in Yemen. If the inquiries result in still more prosecutions, they will underscore a turn toward a more adversarial stance by the government on news gathering -- but one that did not result from a clear policy decision, according to White House and Justice Department officials.\r\nLike most presidents, Mr. Obama has been infuriated by some leaks, but aides say he never ordered investigations. Current and former officials said Mr. Obama and Mr. Holder, who are social friends, have avoided discussing investigations and prosecutions to avoid any appearance of improper White House influence, a charge Democrats lodged against the Bush administration.\r\nAsked whether the White House had a role in the leak cases, a spokesman for the National Security Council, Tommy Vietor, said, ''''Decisions about leak prosecutions are made by the Department of Justice.''''\r\nFor decades, the Justice Department was where leak complaints from the intelligence agencies went to die. The department''s counterespionage section was more interested in finding foreign spies than American blabbermouths, officials said.\r\nLeak cases can also be hard to investigate. When hundreds of officials knew a secret, it was often impossible to find the leaker without a reporter''s testimony. But because subpoenas for reporters raised Constitutional concerns about press freedom, they rarely got approved.\r\nEven after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Justice Department under the Bush administration''s first attorney general, John Ashcroft, let dozens of referrals from intelligence agencies die out of concern that some leak cases could be impossible to make without subpoenaing reporters. There was also concern that prosecution could harm national security by bringing more attention to the disclosures, said Mark Corallo, his director of public affairs.\r\nThat stance began to shift in Mr. Bush''s second term, when Alberto R. Gonzales took over as attorney general. A Pentagon official pleaded guilty to leaking information to two pro-Israel lobbyists, and the administration got into pitched battles with news outlets, including The New York Times, over disclosures about secret prisons and eavesdropping without warrants.\r\nIn addition, the Bush administration assigned at least two cases to hard-charging prosecutors outside the counterespionage section: those of Thomas A. Drake, an N.S.A. official accused of telling The Baltimore Sun about wasteful spending on technology; and of Jeffrey Sterling, a former C.I.A. officer accused of disclosing the agency''s efforts against Iran to James Risen, a reporter for The Times, for a book. Both cases were still open at the end of the Bush years.\r\nChanging technology, meanwhile, was making investigations easier. Government officials and reporters were increasingly leaving electronic trails, including e-mails, cellphone records, credit card receipts and computers that tracked everyone who looked at a particular classified document.\r\nMr. Obama campaigned for the presidency in 2008 championing whistle-blowers who had disclosed government lapses and wrongdoing. But by 2009, in response to complaints from the Congressional intelligence committees about disclosures, a task force created by the Justice Department and the director of national intelligence, Dennis C. Blair, streamlined procedures to follow up on leaks.\r\nAlso, Mr. Blair said, ''''we set up a system for tracking and emphasizing security breach investigations, set deadlines and priorities and kept the pressure on.''''\r\nThe scattered bureaucratic background of the six cases appears to support the notion that they were not the result of a top-down policy. Two were handled by the Justice Department''s criminal division, while two others were developed by the national security division. A case involving a former C.I.A. officer, John Kiriakou, started with an unrelated inquiry at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and ended up as a leak case by accident. And the case against Pfc. Bradley Manning, an Army intelligence analyst accused of delivering huge archives of classified documents to WikiLeaks, was a military prosecution that would most likely have been brought under any administration.\r\nSeveral current and former Justice Department officials in the Obama administration insisted that neither the White House nor Mr. Holder had issued any policy directive calling for more leak prosecutions. Still, Mr. Holder approved issuing a subpoena to Mr. Risen in the Sterling case, was briefed on all the cases before charges were filed and raised no objections, aides said.\r\nMr. Holder, a former career prosecutor, could have halted any of the cases. But to block a case after years of investigation might anger the prosecutors who are supposed to take it to trial.\r\nRichard Thornburgh, who served as attorney general from 1988 to 1991, said he never quashed a leak case -- none were deemed prosecutable during his tenure -- but added that it would be unusual to block a case at the last moment.\r\n''''Ideally, what you would do in a high-profile case is have some early entry to vitiate the need to have to quash it or deter people from bringing it on the eve of indictment,'''' he said.\r\nOnly two of the six cases have concluded: Shamai K. Leibowitz, a Hebrew language translator for the F.B.I., quietly pleaded guilty to disclosing classified information and received a 20-month sentence. Mr. Drake''s case collapsed; he pleaded guilty to a minor charge and got no jail time. That case was particularly embarrassing for the government: critics call Mr. Drake a classic whistle-blower who tried to save taxpayers more than $1 billion.\r\n''''If they had it to over again, I suspect the department likely would not bring the Drake case,'''' said Mr. Miller, the Justice Department''s former spokesman.\r\nMr. Corallo, the former top aide to Mr. Ashcroft, faulted the Obama administration for allowing so many leak cases to go forward. ''''Sometimes the interests of the prosecutor in the field are at odds with the overall health of our republic,'''' Mr. Corallo said, adding that Mr. Holder and his top aides had not been ''''doing their job, which is to make serious judgments about the overall effects of a leak investigation.''''\r\nFacing sharp criticism from Senate Republicans this month for refusing to appoint special counsels for the latest leak investigations, Mr. Holder defended himself by pointing again to the prosecution record.\r\n''''We have tried more leak cases -- brought more leak cases during the course of this administration than any other administration,'''' Mr. Holder told the Senate Judiciary Committee. ''''I was getting hammered by the left for that only two weeks ago. Now I''m getting hammered by the right for potentially not going after leaks. It makes for an interesting dynamic.''''\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: June 20, 2012\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: PHOTO: Asked about leaks during a news conference on June 8, President Obama said, ''''The notion that my White House would purposely release classified national security information is offensive.''''

Bush''s presidency marked a significant and dangerous turning point in the gradual militarization of the Internet. Washington has begun to cross the Rubicon. If it continues, contemporary warfare will change fundamentally as we move into hazardous and uncharted territory.\r\nIt is one thing to write viruses and lock them away safely for future use should circumstances dictate it. It is quite another to deploy them in peacetime. Stuxnet has effectively fired the starting gun in a new arms race that is very likely to lead to the spread of similar and still more powerful offensive cyberweaponry across the Internet. Unlike nuclear or chemical weapons, however, countries are developing cyberweapons outside any regulatory framework.\r\nThere is no international treaty or agreement restricting the use of cyberweapons, which can do anything from controlling an individual laptop to disrupting an entire country''s critical telecommunications or banking infrastructure. It is in the United States'' interest to push for one before the monster it has unleashed comes home to roost.\r\nStuxnet was originally deployed with the specific aim of infecting the Natanz uranium enrichment facility in Iran. This required sneaking a memory stick into the plant to introduce the virus to its private and secure ''''offline'''' network. But despite Natanz''s isolation, Stuxnet somehow escaped into the cyberwild, eventually affecting hundreds of thousands of systems worldwide.\r\nThis is one of the frightening dangers of an uncontrolled arms race in cyberspace; once released, virus developers generally lose control of their inventions, which will inevitably seek out and attack the networks of innocent parties. Moreover, all countries that possess an offensive cyber capability will be tempted to use it now that the first shot has been fired.\r\nUntil recent revelations by The New York Times''s David E. Sanger, there was no definitive proof that America was behind Stuxnet. Now computer security experts have found a clear link between its creators and a newly discovered virus called Flame, which transforms infected computers into multipurpose espionage tools and has infected machines across the Middle East.\r\nThe United States has long been a commendable leader in combating the spread of malicious computer code, known as malware, that pranksters, criminals, intelligence services and terrorist organizations have been using to further their own ends. But by introducing such pernicious viruses as Stuxnet and Flame, America has severely undermined its moral and political credibility.\r\nFlame circulated on the Web for at least four years and evaded detection by the big antivirus operators like McAfee, Symantec, Kaspersky Labs and F-Secure -- companies that are vital to ensuring that law-abiding consumers can go about their business on the Web unmolested by the army of malware writers, who release nasty computer code onto the Internet to steal our money, data, intellectual property or identities. But senior industry figures have now expressed deep worries about the state-sponsored release of the most potent malware ever seen.\r\nDuring the cold war, countries'' chief assets were missiles with nuclear warheads. Generally their number and location was common knowledge, as was the damage they could inflict and how long it would take them to inflict it.\r\nAdvanced cyberwar is different: a country''s assets lie as much in the weaknesses of enemy computer defenses as in the power of the weapons it possesses. So in order to assess one''s own capability, there is a strong temptation to penetrate the enemy''s systems before a conflict erupts. It is no good trying to hit them once hostilities have broken out; they will be prepared and there''s a risk that they already will have infected your systems. Once the logic of cyberwarfare takes hold, it is worryingly pre-emptive and can lead to the uncontrolled spread of malware.\r\nUntil now, America has been reluctant to discuss regulation of the Internet with Russia and China. Washington believes any moves toward a treaty might undermine its presumed superiority in the field of cyberweaponry and robotics. And it fears that Moscow and Beijing would exploit a global regulation of military activity on the Web, in order to justify and further strengthen the powerful tools they already use to restrict their citizens'' freedom on the Net. The United States must now consider entering into discussions, anathema though they may be, with the world''s major powers about the rules governing the Internet as a military domain.\r\nAny agreement should regulate only military uses of the Internet and should specifically avoid any clauses that might affect private or commercial use of the Web. Nobody can halt the worldwide rush to create cyberweapons, but a treaty could prevent their deployment in peacetime and allow for a collective response to countries or organizations that violate it.\r\nTechnical superiority is not written in stone, and the United States is arguably more dependent on networked computer systems than any other country in the world. Washington must halt the spiral toward an arms race, which, in the long term, it is not guaranteed to win.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: June 25, 2012\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: DRAWING (DRAWING BY HENNING WAGENBRETH)\r\n\r\nDOCUMENT-TYPE: Op-Ed\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\r\n', 'robbie');

It was originally intended to allow the government to enforce minimum security standards for the computer systems that govern critical infrastructure systems. But industry opposition compelled the backers of the bill to make it voluntary.\r\nWhat survived was largely a measure to allow private companies and government agencies to share information about cybersecurity threats. Responding to civil libertarians'' worries about the military snooping on private communications, the Obama administration took pains to let the Department of Homeland Security be the main government hub, rather than the National Security Agency. Administration officials expended a great deal of political energy trying to get the bill through the Senate. In the end,  dozens of amendments were attached to it, and it failed to attract the 60 votes needed to get through cloture.\r\nIt is likely to come up again in the fall, though few are optimistic about its prospects.\r\n\r\n•\r\nAgain, Wrangling Over Surveillance in the Cybersecurity Bill \r\n•\r\nHouse Votes to Approve Disputed Cybersecurity Bill \r\n•\r\nLawmakers Want to Know: What Are Those Drones Doing Up There? \r\n•\r\nParenting Dilemmas in the Age of Facial Recognition \r\n•\r\nTwitter Appeals to Protect Protester''s Tweets \r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: August 3, 2012\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nDOCUMENT-TYPE: News\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Web Blog\r\n', 'robbie');

A few journalists elsewhere -- notably Jonathan Landay and Warren Strobel, then of the Knight Ridder newspapers -- dug deeper, discovered contrary intelligence, and challenged the official line. Later, The Times also published some excellent work on how an administration eager to justify its decision to go to war cherry-picked the intelligence to make its case.\r\nThe Times has owned up to -- and, we pray, learned from -- the things we got wrong. But this is a good time to look a little harder at the journalists who got it right. How did they come up with the evidence to refute the version embraced by the president, by most officials in both parties and by a lot of the mainstream media?\r\nThey got it from government officials with access to classified information, who risked their jobs to confide the truth to journalists. Critics call these ''''leaks,'''' although such stories hardly ever spill out unbidden; they are painstakingly assembled by teasing out bits of information, triangulating, correcting, testing, confirming. I''d call them a public service.\r\nWashington is currently going a little nuts on the subject of leaks. The Obama administration, which has, without really setting out to do so, already surpassed all previous administrations in its prosecution of leakers, has begun new investigations into disclosures by The Times, Newsweek, The Associated Press and others. Congress has mandated surveillance systems that make it easier to identify leakers and to prevent unauthorized downloads of classified material.\r\nBut that has not quieted the hysteria. Republicans are accusing the F.B.I. of insufficient zeal and demanding a special prosecutor. Democrats, typically worried about being perceived as soft on national security, have tried to out-deplore the Republicans. Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced a bill the other day that, among other things, would forbid background briefings on intelligence matters by anyone except an agency''s director, deputy director or public-affairs spin doctors -- thus cutting out the officers with firsthand knowledge and silencing those who question the party line. It should be dubbed the Keep Americans in the Dark Act. Feinstein already seems to be backpedaling a bit, after discovering that top intelligence officials think elements of her bill are ridiculous. (For one thing, it applies only to the spy agencies and does not touch the places that routinely consume classified intelligence material -- the White House, the State Department, the Defense Department, allied foreign governments or, perhaps the leakiest vessel in Washington, Congress itself.)\r\nIs this latest outbreak of leak panic just another mood swing? Or is something else going on?\r\nThere is a plausible case that more secrets are spilling these days. In part that is because so much material is automatically, needlessly classified that officials tend not to take classification as seriously. I suspect another factor is the enthusiasm with which senior officials contribute their notes and self-serving recollections for behind-the-scenes books, setting a permissive example for those farther down the official ladder. (The top officials thus assure their place in history; it''s the juniors who get prosecuted.)\r\nSome of the current wailing is just politics as usual, or what has become usual in the pit bull arena of the modern campaign. Mitt Romney, desperate for a way to turn President Obama''s takedown of Osama bin Laden into a liability, has professed to be shocked and outraged that a president or his circle might use classified information to burnish the image of the commander in chief. The Republican nominee-to-be points to stories about Obama''s handling of the Bin Laden raid, his oversight of a terrorist kill list and the administration''s cyberattacks on Iran as ''''contemptible'''' breaches of national security.\r\nRomney certainly knows something about keeping secrets; there have been no leaks so far of his tax returns, the names of his big-money bundlers, the records of his work as governor and Olympics czar or, for that matter, his economic plan.\r\nBut his indignation, if it is not feigned, is a little naive. One of the more insightful watchers of Washington culture had this to say on how things work in the world of information-as-power:\r\n''''Presidents make ''secret'' decisions only to reveal them for the purposes of frightening an adversary nation, wooing a friendly electorate, protecting their reputations. The military services conduct ''secret'' research in weaponry only to reveal it for the purpose of enhancing their budgets, appearing superior or inferior to a foreign army, gaining the vote of a congressman or the favor of a contractor. The Navy uses secret information to run down the weaponry of the Air Force. The Army passes on secret information to prove its superiority to the Marine Corps. High officials of the government reveal secrets in the search for support of their policies, or to help sabotage the plans and policies of rival departments. Middle-rank officials of government reveal secrets so as to attract the attention of their superiors or to lobby against the orders of those superiors.''''\r\nThat was Max Frankel, then the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times, in a 1971 deposition defending the paper''s publication of the secret Vietnam War history called the Pentagon Papers. Frankel acknowledged the self-serving nature of these transactions -- on both sides -- but concluded that this ''''cooperative, competitive, antagonistic and arcane relationship,'''' as he called it, was essential to the working of democracy. Without this trafficking in secrets, he said, ''''there could be no adequate diplomatic, military and political reporting of the kind our people take for granted, either abroad or in Washington, and there could be no mature system of communication between the government and the people.''''\r\nI''m prepared to believe that unauthorized disclosure to the press of classified information has occasionally had dire consequences, though clear-cut examples of that are scarce. More often, what ''''leaks'''' have done is inform Americans about what is being done in their name -- the good (successful targeting of militants, cyberdisruption of Iran''s nuclear program) and the not so good (warrantless eavesdropping, torture). Raise a hand if you''d really prefer not to know those things.\r\nSome of the instances that seem at first glance to be irresponsible breaches of security turn out, on closer study, to be something else. Recently, The Times, along with several other news organizations, disclosed that the United States had successfully planted a double agent in Al Qaeda in Yemen, and managed thereby to thwart the suicide bombing of an airliner. Outing a double agent is a death warrant. But in this case, reporters who worked the story sought and received assurances that the agent had finished his work and moved to safety. The Qaeda double-agent revelations may well have been good for American security: sowing some corrosive mistrust among the fanatics, and creating a potential hero for young Muslims disenchanted with jihad.\r\nOver the decades, rival interests -- the government''s legitimate responsibility to keep some things secret, the press''s constitutional freedom to ferret out information and report it -- have coexisted through informal understandings. The government worked to protect secrets at the source but generally accepted that it had little recourse once they had escaped. Violators were reprimanded, but hardly ever charged under the Espionage Act. Reporters and editors were sometimes persuaded to withhold information if they were convinced it could put lives at risk.\r\nAlexander Bickel, who was the chief counsel for The Times in the Pentagon Papers case, wrote that this accommodation ''''works well only when there is forbearance and continence on both sides. It threatens to break down when the adversaries turn into enemies, when they break diplomatic relations with each other, gird for and wage war. Such conditions threaten graver breakdowns yet, eroding the popular trust and confidence in both government and the press on which effective exercise of the function of both depends.''''\r\nBickel''s argument, in a seminal book of legal philosophy called ''''The Morality of Consent,'''' assumes a respectful -- if adversarial -- relationship between, on one side, an establishment press and, on the other, a government that accepts the value of compromise in the conduct of public affairs. It''s arguable whether we have either of those today.\r\nThe notion of an establishment press is, to say the least, under siege. News comes from a dizzying number of directions. We know from the WikiLeaks case that among the legions of Internet aggregators and disseminators are at least a few who would feel no compunction about disclosing life-threatening information if they got their hands on it.\r\nSo far, though, the secrets that set Washington on edge still tend to come from reporters who have spent years developing relationships with sources, mainstream reporters like Landay and Strobel, or like David Sanger of The Times and Daniel Klaidman of Newsweek, who are prominent among the current targets of the leak police. They operate without security clearances or subpoena powers. They work, rather, with sources who may be scared, who probably know only part of the story, who may have their own agendas that need to be discovered and taken into account. Reporting secret information with confidence usually entails a multitude of sources, ideally backed by documentary evidence.\r\nSo, while the mainstream press might not enjoy the hegemony it held before the Internet, most of what the country knows about the secret activities of its government it knows thanks to news organizations that still take their responsibilities seriously: reporters who check to make sure that the double agent is safe before they publish the story. (WikiLeaks, which has built a reputation on one tremendous leak, is still the exception that proves the rule.)\r\nUnfortunately, these are not days of -- in Bickel''s phrase -- ''''forbearance and continence.'''' We live in a time of zero-sum politics, where trust is scarce and compromise is perilous, and where the hamster-wheel news cycle puts no special value on reflection.\r\nIn a saner Washington, a reasonable effort to control truly harmful leaks might be balanced by an equally serious effort to roll back excessive classification, so that we could have a more informed debate about drones and cyberwarfare and kill lists. In that Washington, we could worry a little less about where the stories came from, and a little more about what''s in them.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: August 6, 2012\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nDOCUMENT-TYPE: Op-Ed\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper', 'robbie');

Increasingly, however, the focus is on developing offensive capabilities, on figuring out how and when the United States might unleash its own malware to disrupt an adversary''s networks. That is potentially dangerous territory.\r\nSuch malware is believed to have little deterrent value against criminals who use computers to steal money from banks or spies who pilfer industrial secrets. But faced with rising intrusions against computers that run America''s military systems and its essential infrastructure -- its power grid, for instance, and its telecommunications networks -- the military here (and elsewhere) sees disruptive software as an essential new tool of war. According to a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the 15 countries with the biggest military budgets are all investing in offensive cyber capabilities.\r\nThe latest step occurred last month when the United States sent out bids for technologies ''''to destroy, deny, degrade, disrupt, corrupt or usurp'''' an adversary''s attempt to use cyberspace for advantage. The Air Force asked for proposals to plan for and manage cyberwarfare, including the ability to launch superfast computer attacks and withstand retaliation.\r\nThe United States, China, Russia, Britain and Israel began developing basic cyberattack capabilities at least a decade ago and are still figuring out how to integrate them into their military operations. Experts say cyberweapons will be used before or during conflicts involving conventional weapons to infect an adversary''s network and disrupt a target, including shutting down military communications. The most prominent example is the Stuxnet virus deployed in 2010 by the United States and Israel to set back Iran''s nuclear program. Other cyberattacks occurred in 2007 against Syria and 1998 against Serbia.\r\nCrucial questions remain unanswered, including what laws of war would apply to decisions to launch an attack. The United States still hasn''t figured out what impact cyberweapons could have on actual battlefield operations or when an aggressive cyber response is required. Nor has Washington settled on who would authorize an attack; experts see roles for both the president and military commanders. There is also the unresolved issue of how to minimize collateral damage -- like making sure malware does not cripple a civilian hospital.\r\nAnother big concern is China, which is blamed for stealing American military secrets. Washington has not had much success persuading Beijing to rein in its hackers. There is a serious risk of miscalculation if, for example, there is a confrontation in the South China Sea. China could misinterpret a move, unleash a cyberattack and trigger a real cyberwar. What''s clearly needed are new international understandings about what constitutes cyber aggression and how governments should respond. Meanwhile, the United States must do what it can to protect its own networks.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/opinion/a-new-kind-of-warfare.html\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: September 10, 2012\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nDOCUMENT-TYPE: Editorial\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\r\n', 'robbie');

Since June, in fact, F.B.I. agents have been investigating leaks to The New York Times about the computer attacks on Tehran.\r\nBut the reticence is giving way. The chorus of official voices speaking publicly about American cyberattack strategy and capabilities is steadily growing, and some experts say greater openness will allow the United States to stake out legal and ethical rules in the uncharted territory of computer combat. Others fear that talking too boldly about American plans could fuel a global computer arms race.\r\nNext month the Pentagon''s research arm will host contractors who want to propose ''''revolutionary technologies for understanding, planning and managing cyberwarfare.'''' It is an ambitious program that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, calls Plan X, and the public description talks about ''''understanding the cyber battlespace,'''' quantifying ''''battle damage'''' and working in Darpa''s ''''cyberwar laboratory.''''\r\nJames A. Lewis, who studies cybersecurity at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, says he sees the Plan X public announcement as ''''a turning point'''' in a long debate over secrecy about cyberwarfare. He said it was timely, given that public documents suggest that at least 12 of the world''s 15 largest militaries are building cyberwarfare programs.\r\n''''I see Plan X as operationalizing and routinizing cyberattack capabilities,'''' Mr. Lewis said. ''''If we talk openly about offensive nuclear capabilities and every other kind, why not cyber?''''\r\nYet like drone aircraft, which similarly can be used for both spying and combat, American cyberattack tools now are passing through a zone of semisecrecy, no longer denied but not fully discussed. President Obama has spoken publicly twice about drones; he has yet to speak publicly on American cyberattacks.\r\nLast week, at a public Cyber Command legal conference, the State Department''s top lawyer, Harold H. Koh -- who gave the Obama administration''s first public speech on targeted killing of terrorists in 2010 -- stated the administration''s position that the law of war, including such principles as minimizing harm to civilians, applies to cyberattacks.\r\nIn August, the Air Force raised eyebrows with a bluntly worded solicitation for papers advising it on ''''cyberspace warfare attack capabilities,'''' including weapons ''''to destroy, deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive, corrupt or usurp'''' an enemy''s computer networks and other high-tech targets.\r\nAnd a few weeks earlier, a top Marine commander recounted at a public conference how he had used ''''cyber operations against my adversary'''' in Afghanistan in 2010. ''''I was able to get inside his nets, infect his command-and-control, and in fact defend myself against his almost constant incursions to get inside my wire,'''' said Lt. Gen. Richard P. Mills, now deputy commandant of the Marine Corps.\r\nCyberwarfare was discussed quite openly in the 1990s, though technological capabilities and targets were far more limited than they are today, said Jason Healey, who heads the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council in Washington.\r\n''''Our current silence dates back 8 or 10 years, and N.S.A. is a big reason,'''' said Mr. Healey, who is working on a history of cyberwarfare.\r\nThe National Security Agency, which plays a central role in Cyber Command, traditionally breaks foreign codes and eavesdrops on foreign communications; it is among the most secretive agencies in government. Years ago it pioneered the field of cyberespionage: breaking into foreign computer systems in order to collect intelligence. The same skills and reflexive secrecy of spies carried over to cyberwarfare, Mr. Healey said. American officials have long preferred to talk cyberdefense, leaving the attack side in the shadows.\r\nThe increased candor recently about cyberoffense results not from a policy change, officials say, but from an inevitable acceptance of attacks on computer networks as a standard part of military and intelligence capabilities. The fact that dozens of Beltway contractors see cyberwarfare as one of the few parts of the defense budget that are likely to grow is also a factor.\r\nWhen Darpa announced a ''''proposers'' day workshop'''' for its Plan X program, the ''''overwhelming response from industry and academia'''' led the defense research agency to expand the event to an extra day, the agency said in a statement. (A Darpa spokesman declined to comment further on Plan X.)\r\nJust as drone-fired missiles have never been a secret to those on the ground, so cyberattacks have consequences that cannot be hidden, even if their origin may be initially uncertain. The computer worm called Stuxnet, devised by the United States and Israel to destroy Iran''s nuclear centrifuges, was quickly detected by computer security experts when it infected networks around the world in 2010 -- but remains highly classified.\r\nHence the Cyber Command legal conference, which avoided specific cases while dwelling on principles. Mr. Koh, of the State Department, told the conference that the United States carries out ''''at least two stages of legal review'''' on cyberwarfare operations -- considering whether the law of war prohibits the use of ''''new weapons'''' altogether and, if not, how the law governs their use in ''''each particular operation.''''\r\nMatthew Waxman, a law professor at Columbia and former Defense Department official, said speaking openly about cyberwarfare policy was important because it allowed the United States to make clear its intentions on a novel and fast-emerging form of conflict.\r\nBecause both the Bush and Obama administrations were slow to speak publicly about their use of armed drones, Mr. Waxman said, ''''they ceded a lot of ground to critics to shape the narrative and portray U.S. practices as lawless.'''' As a result, he said, ''''the U.S. is trying to play catch-up, giving speech after speech, saying ''We abide by the law.'' ''''\r\nNow, Mr. Waxman said, because the United States ''''occupies a position of advantage on offensive cyber capabilities, it should seize the opportunity to lay out a set of rules for itself and others.''''\r\nThat is a worthy goal, said Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. But he said that came with a hazard: more talk about the United States'' cyberwarfare capabilities might prompt other countries to step up their own programs at a time when the world is ''''on the cusp of a cyber arms race,'''' he said.\r\nMr. Kimball said Darpa''s sweeping public statement about the goals of its Plan X for cyberwarfare might be a case in point.\r\n''''It makes it sound like the U.S. is preparing to be able to wage a full-out cyberwar,'''' Mr. Kimball said. ''''Those kinds of statements could come back to haunt the U.S. down the road.''''\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/us/us-officials-opening-up-on-cyberwarfare.html\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: October 1, 2012\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\r\n', 'robbie');

SCHMIDT, KEITH BRADSHER and CHRISTINE HAUSER; Michael S. Schmidt reported from Washington and Christine Hauser from New York. Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong, and Quentin Hardy from San Francisco.\r\n\r\nSECTION: Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1\r\n\r\nLENGTH: 1247 words\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON -- In the latest development to highlight the sensitive terrain that the United States and China are navigating on economic issues, a House committee issued a blistering bipartisan report on Monday that accused two of China''s largest telecommunications companies of being arms of the government that had stolen intellectual property from American companies and could potentially spy on Americans.\r\nThe House Intelligence Committee said that after a yearlong investigation it had come to the conclusion that the Chinese businesses, Huawei Technologies and ZTE Inc., were a national security threat because of their attempts to extract sensitive information from American companies and their loyalties to the Chinese government.\r\nThe companies sell telecommunications equipment needed to create and operate wireless networks, like the ones used by Verizon Wireless and AT&T. Many of the major suppliers of the equipment are based outside the United States, creating concerns here about the security of communications.\r\nThose concerns are most acute about Huawei and ZTE because of their close ties to the Chinese government, which the committee said has heavily subsidized the companies. Allowing the Chinese companies to do business in the United States, the report said, would give the Chinese government the ability to easily intercept communications and could allow it to start online attacks on critical infrastructure, like dams and power grids.\r\nThe release of the report comes as both presidential candidates have spoken of the importance of United States ties with China and have promised to act strongly on Chinese currency and trade practices that are damaging to American business interests.\r\nMitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, has called repeatedly during his campaign for a more confrontational approach to China on business issues, although he has focused his warnings more on Chinese currency market interventions than on the activities of the nation''s telecommunications companies.\r\nPresident Obama has also taken a tougher stance on China recently. Late last month, Mr. Obama, through the Committee on Foreign Investment, ordered a Chinese company to divest itself of interests in four wind farm projects near a Navy base in Oregon where drone aircraft training takes place. It was the first time a president had blocked such a deal in 22 years.\r\nThe Obama administration has also filed a case at the World Trade Organization in Geneva accusing China of unfairly subsidizing its exports of autos and auto parts, the ninth trade action the administration has brought against China.\r\n''''We have a process that is not aimed at one specific company but using all the assets and parts of U.S. government aimed at protecting our telecommunications and critical infrastructure,'''' a senior White House official said.\r\nThe report was released on Monday morning at a news conference held by\r\nRepresentative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and Representative C. A. Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee.\r\nThey said that the United States government should be barred from doing business with Huawei and ZTE and that American companies should avoid buying their equipment.\r\nThe report said the committee had obtained internal documents from former employees of Huawei that showed it supplied services to a ''''cyberwarfare'''' unit in the People''s Liberation Army.\r\nThe United States government, the report said, should go through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency panel that reviews the national security implications of foreign investments, to carry out its recommendations. It also said that committee should block any mergers and acquisitions involving the Chinese companies and American businesses.\r\nIn the course of the investigation, the House committee said it had uncovered evidence of economic espionage -- and officials said on Monday that they planned to hand over the evidence to the F.B.I.\r\nFormer and current employees for Huawei, the report said, told investigators for the committee that the company had committed ''''potential violations'''' in the United States related to immigration, bribery, corruption and copyright infringement.\r\nHuawei has been the focus of criticism and security warnings for years, including by the Defense Department. Its expansion plans in the United States have faced resistance from Congress over questions about its ties to the military in China.\r\nHuawei denies being financed to undertake research and development for the Chinese military, and its executives have repeatedly insisted that they have nothing to hide. The company issued an open letter to the United States government in February 2011, asking for an inquiry to clear up what it characterized as misperceptions about its history and business operations.\r\nAt the news conference, Mr. Rogers and Mr. Ruppersberger said they told the Chinese companies that they had to be moretransparent but were disappointed by incomplete and contradictory responses to their questions. Mr. Rogers said the committee was concerned that the companies were extensions of the Chinese government because they were so heavily financed by it.\r\nIn testimony before the House committee in September, officials from both Huawei and ZTE said that supposed ''''back doors'''' in its software that provided unauthorized access to American companies'' computers were flaws, not intentional vulnerabilities.\r\nBut Mr. Rogers said the companies had been told to tell the Chinese to ''''stop hacking'''' into American companies and infrastructure if they wanted to do business in the United States.\r\n''''The world is a changed place,'''' Mr. Rogers said. ''''We better have faith and confidence in our network.''''\r\nIn a statement, Huawei condemned the committee''s investigation and report. ''''Unfortunately, the committee''s report not only ignored our proven track record of network security in the United States and globally, but also paid no attention to the large amount of facts that we have provided,'''' Huawei said in its statement, later adding that ''''the report released by the committee today employs many rumors and speculations to prove nonexistent accusations.''''\r\nHuawei has had considerable success in winning large telecommunications contracts in Europe and in emerging markets. But it has had little success in the United States, where politicians have long worried, despite Huawei''s denials, that it might be used for Chinese eavesdropping or other cyberwarfare activities.\r\nThe company was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a former officer of the People''s Liberation Army and a military technology researcher who has run it ever since. The company is owned by its employees and, unlike many Chinese corporations, has chosen not to sell shares in Hong Kong or the United States, which would equire financial disclosures.\r\nZTE said on Monday that it ''''had set an unprecedented standard for cooperation by any Chinese company'''' with a Congressional investigation.\r\n''''ZTE is China''s most transparent, independent, globally focused, publicly traded telecom company,'''' the company said in a statement.\r\nAt a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing on Monday before the release of the report in Washington, Hong Lei, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said ''''I hope the United States will respect the facts, abandon prejudice and do more things conducive to China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation, rather than the opposite.''''\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/us/us-panel-calls-huawei-and-zte-national-security-threat.html\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: October 9, 2012\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Representative Mike Rogers, left, Republican of Michigan, talked on Monday about Chinese security threats.

HUNT | BLOOMBERG VIEWS\r\n\r\nSECTION: Section ; Column 0; Foreign Desk; LETTER FROM WASHINGTON; Pg.\r\n\r\nLENGTH: 849 words\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats have a problem called Robert Menendez. It may mean that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which the lawmaker heads, will be unable to play an important and much-needed role of overseer.\r\nThe New Jersey Democrat became chairman of the panel when John Kerry was tapped to be secretary of state. Never a foreign policy heavyweight to begin with, Mr. Menendez is now the subject of conflict-of-interest allegations that are being looked at by the F.B.I. and the Senate Ethics Committee.\r\nThe Foreign Relations Committee has never been a driving legislative venue, keeping mostly to ratifying treaties. It can, however, serve as a valuable classroom to spotlight crucial foreign policy issues -- and as an oversight panel whose chairman can have a complementary role in shaping policies.\r\nNone of that seems possible under Mr. Menendez, known chiefly during his single term in the Senate as a savvy, tough politician and a prodigious fund-raiser.\r\nIt is one of these big contributors, a Florida doctor, who is currently causing problems for the 59-year-old lawmaker; Mr. Menendez is accused of having improperly intervened to help his donor with contracts in the Dominican Republic.\r\nThe senator insists he has done nothing wrong. Some of the allegations, of personal rather than professional lapses, may well be phony and fueled by politics. He is presumed innocent in all cases, although the accusations are serious enough, even if there were no illegal acts, to diminish his credibility as a national figure.\r\nMr. Menendez is an accidental chairman. Since 2008, five more senior Democrats have left the panel, including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Kerry.\r\nAt times, the Foreign Relations Committee has played a pivotal role in U.S. policy. Negatively, it was a Republican chairman, Henry Cabot Lodge, who scuttled President Woodrow Wilson''s League of Nations after World War I. After World War II, another Republican chairman, Arthur H. Vandenberg, fashioned a bipartisan foreign policy with the Truman administration.\r\nAlmost a half century ago, Chairman J. William Fulbright, in a remarkable series of hearings, questioned the underlying rationale and wisdom of the war in Vietnam, which he had initially supported. The Fulbright sessions opened the door to a national dialogue and debate that ultimately led to the U.S. withdrawal.\r\nSenator Richard G. Lugar, a Republican, in two separate stints as chairman, reinvigorated the committee, even if it was too often ignored by the president and the public.\r\nOn the eve of the invasion of Iraq, the panel heard from Gen. Anthony Zinni of the U.S. Marine Corps and other experts that the architects of the conflict were totally ill-prepared for a post-combat occupation. They ridiculed administration claims that rebuilding could be achieved within two years, that the weapons of mass destruction would be destroyed and that a vibrant new political and economic system would emerge.\r\nTen years later, Iraq has yet to create a viable political and economic system.\r\nEven though they went unheeded, Mr. Lugar''s efforts set the predicate for the ensuing, robust debate.\r\nThe shorter Kerry stint wasn''t as productive, but the Massachusetts senator played a contributory role as an unofficial special envoy to trouble spots for the Obama administration.\r\nAs secretary of state, he will be solicitous of his former committee. In the Obama administration, however, foreign policy has been set mainly in the White House, which shows little interest in congressional prerogatives; transparency has been less than promised and the role of Congress, in matters like Libya, ignored.\r\nThere could be an important agenda for a vibrant committee: the challenges of cyberwarfare; the Arab Spring; possible confrontation with Iran; and Mr. Obama''s so-called pivot to Asia.\r\nThe oversight function, so often ignored by Congress, could also be valuable, for example, on foreign aid: how it''s done, where it succeeds and where it doesn''t.\r\nThere are other Senate panels dealing with national security: the Armed Services Committee, which does a decent job of oversight, and the Intelligence Committee, which doesn''t.\r\nForeign Relations seems destined for a return to the days of ineffective chairmen like Claiborne Pell, a Democrat, or polarizing ones like Jesse Helms, a Republican, even though the current senior minority member, Bob Corker of Tennessee, is willing to work with Democrats.\r\nThat''s unfortunate. Although no administration believes it, it is healthy when Congress keeps its feet to the fire, not with cheap shots -- as with the Benghazi imbroglio -- but in a serious fashion, by broadening the discussion about major geopolitical concerns, certainly war and peace.\r\nInstead, the recent warnings of former Senator Jim Webb in The National Interest will probably resonate: ''''On the issues of who should decide when and where to use force and for how long, and what our country''s long-term relations should consist of in the aftermath,'''' he wrote in the journal, ''''Congress is mostly tolerated and frequently ignored.''''\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/us/11iht-letter11.html\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: March 11, 2013\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper\r\n', 'robbie');

Panetta warned Thursday that the United States was facing the possibility of a ''''cyber-Pearl Harbor'''' and was increasingly vulnerable to foreign computer hackers who could dismantle the nation''s power grid, transportation system, financial networks and government.\r\nIn a speech at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in New York, Mr. Panetta painted a dire picture of how such an attack on the United States might unfold. He said he was reacting to increasing aggressiveness and technological advances by the nation''s adversaries, which officials identified as China, Russia, Iran and militant groups.\r\n''''An aggressor nation or extremist group could use these kinds of cyber tools to gain control of critical switches,'''' Mr. Panetta said. ''''They could derail passenger trains, or even more dangerous, derail passenger trains loaded with lethal chemicals. They could contaminate the water supply in major cities, or shut down the power grid across large parts of the country.''''\r\nDefense officials insisted that Mr. Panetta''s words were not hyperbole, and that he was responding to a recent wave of cyberattacks on large American financial institutions. He also cited an attack in August on the state oil company Saudi Aramco, which infected and made useless more than 30,000 computers.\r\nBut Pentagon officials acknowledged that Mr. Panetta was also pushing for legislation on Capitol Hill. It would require new standards at critical private-sector infrastructure facilities -- like power plants, water treatment facilities and gas pipelines -- where a computer breach could cause significant casualties or economic damage.\r\nIn August, a cybersecurity bill that had been one of the administration''s national security priorities was blocked by a group of Republicans, led by Senator John McCain of Arizona, who took the side of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and said it would be too burdensome for corporations.\r\nThe most destructive possibilities, Mr. Panetta said, involve ''''cyber-actors launching several attacks on our critical infrastructure at one time, in combination with a physical attack.'''' He described the collective result as a ''''cyber-Pearl Harbor that would cause physical destruction and the loss of life, an attack that would paralyze and shock the nation and create a profound new sense of vulnerability.''''\r\nMr. Panetta also argued against the idea that new legislation would be costly for business. ''''The fact is that to fully provide the necessary protection in our democracy, cybersecurity must be passed by the Congress,'''' he told his audience, Business Executives for National Security. ''''Without it, we are and we will be vulnerable.''''\r\nWith the legislation stalled, Mr. Panetta said President Obama was weighing the option of issuing an executive order that would promote information sharing on cybersecurity between government and private industry. But Mr. Panetta made clear that he saw it as a stopgap measure and that private companies, which are typically reluctant to share internal information with the government, would cooperate fully only if required to by law.\r\n''''We''re not interested in looking at e-mail, we''re not interested in looking at information in computers, I''m not interested in violating rights or liberties of people,'''' Mr. Panetta told editors and reporters at The New York Times earlier on Thursday. ''''But if there is a code, if there''s a worm that''s being inserted, we need to know when that''s happening.''''\r\nHe said that with an executive order making cooperation by the private sector only voluntary, ''''I''m not sure they''re going to volunteer if they don''t feel that they''re protected legally in terms of sharing information.''''\r\n''''So our hope is that ultimately we can get Congress to adopt that kind of legislation,'''' he added.\r\nMr. Panetta''s comments, his most extensive to date on cyberwarfare, also sought to increase the level of public debate about the Defense Department''s growing capacity not only to defend but also to carry out attacks over computer networks. Even so, he carefully avoided using the words ''''offense'''' or ''''offensive'''' in the context of American cyberwarfare, instead defining the Pentagon''s capabilities as ''''action to defend the nation.''''\r\nThe United States has nonetheless engaged in its own cyberattacks against adversaries, although it has never publicly admitted it. From his first months in office, Mr. Obama ordered sophisticated attacks on the computer systems that run Iran''s main nuclear enrichment plants, according to participants in the program. He decided to accelerate the attacks, which were begun in the Bush administration and code-named Olympic Games, even after an element of the program accidentally became public in the summer of 2010.\r\nIn a part of the speech notable for carefully chosen words, Mr. Panetta warned that the United States ''''won''t succeed in preventing a cyberattack through improved defenses alone.''''\r\n''''If we detect an imminent threat of attack that will cause significant physical destruction in the United States or kill American citizens, we need to have the option to take action against those who would attack us, to defend this nation when directed by the president,'''' Mr. Panetta said. ''''For these kinds of scenarios, the department has developed the capability to conduct effective operations to counter threats to our national interests in cyberspace.''''\r\nThe comments indicated that the United States might redefine defense in cyberspace as requiring the capacity to reach forward over computer networks if an attack was detected or anticipated, and take pre-emptive action. These same offensive measures also could be used in a punishing retaliation for a first-strike cyberattack on an American target, senior officials said.\r\nSenior Pentagon officials declined to describe specifics of what offensive cyberwarfare abilities the Defense Department has fielded or is developing. And while Mr. Panetta avoided labeling them as ''''offensive,'''' other senior military and Pentagon officials have recently begun acknowledging their growing focus on these tools.\r\nThe Defense Department is finalizing ''''rules of engagement'''' that would put the Pentagon''s cyberweapons into play only in case of an attack on American targets that rose to some still unspecified but significant levels.

Beijing has denied any role in computer hacking, saying the activity is illegal.\r\nAsked on the ABC News program "This Week" whether he believed that the Chinese government and military were behind the economic espionage, Mr. Rogers replied, "Beyond a shadow of a doubt."\r\nHe said the attacks were illegal and unprecedented in scope, and that the United States was not currently able to protect American companies from them.\r\n"We''re not ready yet," he said. "We are completely vulnerable to this."\r\nMr. Rogers suggested that the United States use not just economic sanctions on those responsible but also to take tough action against specific Chinese individuals.\r\n"I argue you need to start indicting bad actors," he said. "You need to start impacting individuals'' ability who are participating in this activity in China to get visas, their families to get visas."\r\n"It''s that serious," he said.\r\nRepresentative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on the same program that he had confronted top Chinese officials with the accusations during a recent visit to Beijing.

He said Washington should make it clear to the Chinese that "there''s a price to pay."\r\nWhile some reports have suggested that the United States and Israel were likely behind cyberattacks against Iran''s nuclear program, Mr. Rogers made two points: First, he said, that people should be "very cautious about ascribing authorship" for those attacks and, second, that such defensive attacks were different from the sort of economic espionage that China is suspected to be involved in.\r\nThat, he said, was why he would "send a message to China that you cannot - if you want to be an international player, you can''t act like a thief in the night."\r\n\r\n•\r\nMonday''s Debate Puts Focus on Foreign Policy Clashes \r\n•\r\nFiling Trade Suit, Obama Raps Romney on China \r\n•\r\nEven the Chinese Muse About Hillary Clinton''s Future \r\n•\r\nRomney Brushes Off Criticism Over Bain Purchase in China \r\n•\r\nRomney Condemns Biden''s Comments on China''s One-Child Policy \r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: February 24, 2013\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nDOCUMENT-TYPE: News\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Web Blog', 'robbie');

The report identified P.L.A. Unit 61398 in Shanghai as one of the most aggressive computer hacking operations in the world.\r\nGeng Yansheng, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, said that China had been the victim of cyberattacks that have originated in the United States and that Mandiant had mischaracterized China''s activities.\r\n''''Chinese military forces have never supported any hacking activities,'''' Mr. Geng said at the briefing. ''''The claim by the Mandiant company that the Chinese military engages in Internet espionage has no foundation in fact.''''\r\nOn Tuesday, a spokesman for China''s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hong Lei, made similar remarks, arguing that cyberattacks were difficult to trace because they were ''''often carried out internationally and are typically done so anonymously.''''\r\nThe New York Times reported on Tuesday that a growing body of digital forensic evidence pointed to the involvement of the army unit in Shanghai and that American intelligence officials had also been tracking the unit''s activities.\r\nOn its Web site, Mandiant released a long report on Tuesday detailing some of its evidence, including Internet protocol addresses and even the identities of several Chinese individuals it thinks were behind some of the attacks. Mandiant said it had monitored the hackers as they logged onto social networking sites or through e-mail accounts.\r\nAttempts to contact two of the individuals through phone numbers and instant message services were unsuccessful. In one case, an individual, whose online profile said he was 28 years old and a graduate of a university that specializes in computer science, declined to answer questions.\r\nSeveral military analysts said they had also traced some serious cyberattacks back to the People''s Liberation Army and its Shanghai Unit 61398, which is known to be engaged in network security.\r\nStill, many security experts concede that it is difficult if not impossible to know for certain where attacks originate, because hackers often take control of computers in various places.\r\nChinese officials have insisted in recent years that China is one of the biggest targets of cyberattacks.\r\n''''Statistics show that Chinese military terminals connected to the Internet have been subjected to large numbers of attacks from abroad,'''' the defense ministry said on Wednesday, adding that Internet protocol addresses ''''indicate that a considerable number of these attacks are from the United States, but we have never used this as a reason to accuse the United States.''''\r\n''''Every country should handle the problem of cybersecurity in a professional and responsible manner,'''' the ministry said.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/business/global/china-says-army-not-behind-attacks-in-report.html\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: February 21, 2013\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: PHOTO: Hong Lei of China''s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2010.

Two recent developments, however, should raise the political costs for China and may cause it to alter its calculus. Refusal to change its conduct could make its relations with the United States even more difficult than they are.\r\nOn Tuesday, a new report from Mandiant, an American computer security firm, publicly documented an explicit link between Chinese hackers and the People''s Liberation Army. The report cites a growing body of digital forensic evidence that most of the attacks on American corporations, organizations and government agencies originate in and around a 12-story office tower on the outskirts of Shanghai that is the headquarters of P.L.A. Unit 61398.\r\nMandiant tracked individual members of the most sophisticated of the Chinese hacking groups, known as ''''Comment Crew'''' or ''''Shanghai Group,'''' to the headquarters of the military unit, which is central to China''s computer espionage operations. It followed ''''Comment Crew'''' for six years, monitoring 141 attacks by looking at Web domains, malware, Internet protocol addresses and embedded codes.\r\nReporters for The Times confirmed the evidence contained in the report with American intelligence officials who say they have tapped into the activity of the army unit for years.\r\nChinese officials denounced the report, but their reaction was hardly a denial. ''''Hacking attacks are transnational and anonymous. Determining their origins are extremely difficult. We don''t know how the evidence in this so-called report can be tenable,'''' said Hong Lei, a Foreign Ministry spokesman.\r\nIn a second development that could further raise the stakes for Beijing, Washington decided to share with American Internet providers and antivirus vendors information about the unique signatures of the largest of the Chinese groups, including those originating from the area where Unit 61398 is based. The government warnings will not link the hackers and their computers to the Chinese Army per se, but the effects will be felt when the hackers and computers are denied access to American networks, as many of the Internet providers and antivirus vendors are expected to do.\r\nAmerican officials are increasingly concerned about cyberattacks intended not just to steal corporate secrets but also, as President Obama said in his recent State of the Union address, to ''''sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, our air traffic control systems.''''\r\nAs a defensive measure, Mr. Obama last week signed an executive order promoting increased information-sharing about cyberthreats between the government and private companies that oversee the country''s critical infrastructure, including its electrical power grid, gas lines and waterworks. Congress still has not acted on legislation setting minimum requirements for how this infrastructure should be protected. A reasonably strong bill offered in the Senate last summer has been stymied by objections from some legislators that it would be too intrusive. So far, Mr. Obama has chosen not to have a public collision with China. He and his aides have largely raised their concerns in private. But patience is wearing thin as China-emanated attacks have grown and the administration pursues a more aggressive response.\r\nChina and the United States have to cooperate on numerous international security issues. But that won''t happen if they end up in a cyberwar. Publicizing China''s transgressions and blocking Internet access to hackers should be a warning to Beijing. Washington is right to defend its interests. But the two nations need to take the lead in negotiating new international understandings about what constitutes cyberaggression and how governments should respond.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/opinion/chinas-cybergames.html\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: February 20, 2013\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nDOCUMENT-TYPE: Editorial\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper', 'robbie');

In a book called ''''The Dispensable Nation,'''' to be published in April, Nasr delivers a devastating portrait of a first-term foreign policy that shunned the tough choices of real diplomacy, often descended into pettiness, and was controlled ''''by a small cabal of relatively inexperienced White House advisers.''''\r\nNasr, one of the most respected American authorities on the Middle East, served as senior adviser to Richard Holbrooke, Obama''s special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan until his death in December 2010. From that vantage point, and later as a close observer, Nasr was led to the reluctant conclusion that the principal aim of Obama''s policies ''''is not to make strategic decisions but to satisfy public opinion.''''\r\nIn this sense the first-term Obama foreign policy was successful: He was re-elected. Americans wanted extrication from the big wars and a smaller global footprint: Obama, with some back and forth, delivered. But the price was high and opportunities lost.\r\n''''The Dispensable Nation'''' constitutes important reading as John Kerry moves into his new job as secretary of state. It nails the drift away from the art of diplomacy -- with its painful give-and-take -- toward a U.S. foreign policy driven by the Pentagon, intelligence agencies and short-term political calculus. It holds the president to account for his zigzags from Kabul to Jerusalem.\r\nIt demonstrates the emasculation of the State Department: Vasr quotes Admiral Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, telling him of Hillary Clinton that, ''''It is incredible how little support she got from the White House. They want to control everything.'''' And it paints a persuasive picture of an American decline driven not so much by the inevitable rise of other powers as by ''''inconsistency'''' that has ''''cast doubt on our leadership.''''\r\nNowhere was this inconsistency more evident than in Afghanistan. Obama doubled-down by committing tens of thousands more troops to show he was no wimp, only to set a date for a drawdown to show he was no warmonger. Marines died; few cared.\r\nHe appointed Holbrooke as his point man only to ensure that he ''''never received the authority to do diplomacy.'''' Obama''s message to President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan was: ''''Ignore my special representative.'''' The White House campaign against Holbrooke was ''''a theater of the absurd,'''' Nasr writes. ''''Holbrooke was not included in Obama''s videoconferences with Karzai and was cut out of the presidential retinue when Obama went to Afghanistan.''''\r\nThe White House seemed ''''more interested in bringing Holbrooke down than getting the policy right.'''' The pettiness was striking: ''''The White House kept a dossier on Holbrooke''s misdeeds and Clinton kept a folder on churlish attempts by the White House''s AfPak office to undermine Holbrooke.''''\r\nDiplomacy died. Serious negotiation with the Taliban and involving Iran in talks on Afghanistan''s future -- bold steps that carried a domestic political price -- were shunned. The use of trade as a bridge got scant attention. Nasr concludes on Afghanistan: ''''We are just washing our hands of it, hoping there will be a decent interval of calm -- a reasonable distance between our departure and the catastrophe to follow.''''\r\nIn Pakistan, too nuclear to ignore, the ultimate ''''frenemy,'''' Nasr observed policy veering between frustrated confrontation and half-hearted attempts to change the relationship through engagement. ''''The crucial reality was that the Taliban helped Pakistan face down India in the contest over Afghanistan,'''' Nasr writes. America was never able to change that equation. Aid poured in to secure those nukes and win hearts and minds: Drones drained away any gratitude. A proposed ''''strategic dialogue'''' went nowhere. ''''Pakistan is a failure of American policy, a failure of the sort that comes from the president handing foreign policy over to the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies.''''\r\nIn Iran, Nasr demonstrates Obama''s deep ambivalence about any deal on the nuclear program. ''''Pressure,'''' he writes, ''''has become an end in itself.'''' The dual track of ever tougher sanctions combined with diplomatic outreach was ''''not even dual. It relied on one track, and that was pressure.'''' The reality was that, ''''Engagement was a cover for a coercive campaign of sabotage, economic pressure and cyberwarfare.''''\r\nOpportunities to begin real step-by-step diplomacy involving Iran giving up its low-enriched uranium in exchange for progressive sanctions relief were lost. What was Tehran to think when ''''the sum total of three major rounds of diplomatic negotiation was that America would give some bits and bobs of old aircraft in exchange for Iran''s nuclear program''''?\r\nOn Israel-Palestine, as with Iran, Obama began with some fresh ideas only to retreat. He tried to stop Israeli settlement expansion. Then he gave up when the domestic price looked too high. The result has been drift.\r\n''''The Dispensable Nation'''' is a brave book. Its core message is: Diplomacy is tough and carries a price, but the price is higher when it is abandoned.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/opinion/global/roger-cohen-the-end-of-foreign-policy.html\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: February 19, 2013\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nDOCUMENT-TYPE: Op-Ed\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper', 'robbie');

When the executive clicked on a malicious link in the e-mail, it gave the attackers a foothold inside Coca-Cola''s network. From inside, they sent confidential company files through a maze of computers back to Shanghai, on a weekly basis, unnoticed.\r\nAn earlier version of this article misspelled a company name.

SANGER and THOM SHANKER\r\n\r\nSECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1\r\n\r\nLENGTH: 1284 words\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON -- A secret legal review on the use of America''s growing arsenal of cyberweapons has concluded that President Obama has the broad power to order a pre-emptive strike if the United States detects credible evidence of a major digital attack looming from abroad, according to officials involved in the review.\r\nThat decision is among several reached in recent months as the administration moves, in the next few weeks, to approve the nation''s first rules for how the military can defend, or retaliate, against a major cyberattack. New policies will also govern how the intelligence agencies can carry out searches of faraway computer networks for signs of potential attacks on the United States and, if the president approves, attack adversaries by injecting them with destructive code -- even if there is no declared war.\r\nThe rules will be highly classified, just as those governing drone strikes have been closely held. John O. Brennan, Mr. Obama''s chief counterterrorism adviser and his nominee to run the Central Intelligence Agency, played a central role in developing the administration''s policies regarding both drones and cyberwarfare, the two newest and most politically sensitive weapons in the American arsenal.\r\nCyberweaponry is the newest and perhaps most complex arms race under way. The Pentagon has created a new Cyber Command, and computer network warfare is one of the few parts of the military budget that is expected to grow. Officials said that the new cyberpolicies had been guided by a decade of evolution in counterterrorism policy, particularly on the division of authority between the military and the intelligence agencies in deploying cyberweapons. Officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk on the record.\r\nUnder current rules, the military can openly carry out counterterrorism missions in nations where the United States operates under the rules of war, like Afghanistan. But the intelligence agencies have the authority to carry out clandestine drone strikes and commando raids in places like Pakistan and Yemen, which are not declared war zones. The results have provoked wide protests.\r\nMr. Obama is known to have approved the use of cyberweapons only once, early in his presidency, when he ordered an escalating series of cyberattacks against Iran''s nuclear enrichment facilities. The operation was code-named Olympic Games, and while it began inside the Pentagon under President George W. Bush, it was quickly taken over by the National Security Agency, the largest of the intelligence agencies, under the president''s authority to conduct covert action.\r\nAs the process of defining the rules of engagement began more than a year ago, one senior administration official emphasized that the United States had restrained its use of cyberweapons. ''''There are levels of cyberwarfare that are far more aggressive than anything that has been used or recommended to be done,'''' the official said.\r\nThe attacks on Iran illustrated that a nation''s infrastructure can be destroyed without bombing it or sending in saboteurs.\r\nWhile many potential targets are military, a country''s power grids, financial systems and communications networks can also be crippled. Even more complex, nonstate actors, like terrorists or criminal groups, can mount attacks, and it is often difficult to tell who is responsible. Some critics have said the cyberthreat is being exaggerated by contractors and consultants who see billions in potential earnings.\r\nOne senior American official said that officials quickly determined that the cyberweapons were so powerful that -- like nuclear weapons -- they should be unleashed only on the direct orders of the commander in chief.\r\nA possible exception would be in cases of narrowly targeted tactical strikes by the military, like turning off an air defense system during a conventional strike against an adversary.\r\n''''There are very, very few instances in cyberoperations in which the decision will be made at a level below the president,'''' the official said. That means the administration has ruled out the use of ''''automatic'''' retaliation if a cyberattack on America''s infrastructure is detected, even if the virus is traveling at network speeds.\r\nWhile the rules have been in development for more than two years, they are coming out at a time of greatly increased cyberattacks on American companies and critical infrastructure. The Department of Homeland Security recently announced that an American power station, which it did not name, was crippled for weeks by cyberattacks. The New York Times reported last week that it had been struck, for more than four months, by a cyberattack emanating from China. The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post have reported similar attacks on their systems.\r\n''''While this is all described in neutral terms -- what are we going to do about cyberattacks -- the underlying question is, ''What are we going to do about China?'' '''' said Richard Falkenrath, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''''There''s a lot of signaling going on between the two countries on this subject.''''\r\nInternational law allows any nation to defend itself from threats, and the United States has applied that concept to conduct pre-emptive attacks.\r\nPre-emption always has been a disputed legal concept. Most recently former Mr. Bush made it a central justification for the invasion of Iraq in 2003, based on faulty intelligence about that country''s weapons of mass destruction. Pre-emption in the context of cyberwar raises a potentially bigger quandary, because a country hit by a pre-emptive cyberstrike could easily claim that it was innocent, undermining the justification for the attack. ''''It would be very hard to provide evidence to the world that you hit some deadly dangerous computer code,'''' one senior official said.\r\nThe implications of pre-emption in cyberwar were specifically analyzed at length in writing the new rules. One major issue involved in the administration''s review, according to one official involved, was defining ''''what constitutes reasonable and proportionate force'''' in halting or retaliating against a cyberattack.\r\nDuring the attacks on Iran''s facilities, which the United States never acknowledged, Mr. Obama insisted that cyberweapons be targeted narrowly, so that they did not affect hospitals or power supplies. Mr. Obama frequently voiced concerns that America''s use of cyberweapons could be used by others as justification for attacks on the United States. The American effort was exposed when the cyberweapon leaked out of the Iranian enrichment center that was attacked, and the ''''Stuxnet'''' code replicated millions of times on the Internet.\r\nUnder the new guidelines, the Pentagon would not be involved in defending against ordinary cyberattacks on American companies or individuals, even though it has the largest array of cybertools. Domestically, that responsibility falls to the Department of Homeland Security, and investigations of cyberattacks or theft are carried out by the F.B.I.\r\nBut the military, barred from actions within the United States without a presidential order, would become involved in cases of a major cyberattack within the United States. To maintain ambiguity in an adversary''s mind, officials have kept secret what that threshold would be; so far, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta has only described the ''''red line'''' in the vaguest of terms -- as a ''''cyber 9/11.''''\r\nThe Obama administration has urged stronger firewalls and other systems to provide a first line of defense, and then ''''resiliency'''' in the face of cyberattacks. It failed to get Congress to pass cybersecurity legislation that would have allowed the government to mandate standards.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/us/broad-powers-seen-for-obama-in-cyberstrikes.html\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: February 4, 2013\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper', 'robbie');

Now that Hillary Clinton has left Foggy Bottom for a well-earned rest, it''s worth stating that public diplomacy -- even of the remarkably successful kind that she embodied -- was not Thomas Jefferson''s idea of being the country''s chief diplomat, nor, one suspects, Clinton''s.\r\nAn extraordinarily able and shrewd politician with an unmatched global Rolodex, Clinton accepted early on a circumscribed definition of the role for reasons that probably only she truly knows. For the United States, and the world, however, it has left a legacy of diplomatic detachment from a range of conflicts and challenges that require more than occasional presidential rhetoric and judicious reserve about the use of military force.\r\nLooking back, it is clear that the role of secretary of state in the Obama administration was constructed around primarily domestic priorities: first, managing successfully the poisonous political rivalry between the two giants of the Democratic Party; second, reassuring the American public that the ''''era of wars'''' was indeed coming to an end; and third, that when America would project its power and influence to neutralize national security threats, it would be far more in the form of drones and special forces than diplomats.\r\nThe great promise of a president uniquely prepared by heritage, intellect and experience to guide America''s 21st century global mission with a global perspective gave way to a largely reluctant, conventional -- and highly militarized -- form of engagement with the world.\r\nUnderlying these political motivations was the deeply held belief that in the aftermath of the Great Recession the country''s global position was defined entirely by its economic strength. ''''Foreign policy begins at home'''' became a mantra as familiar in the era of economic crisis as ''''Yes, we can'''' was during the 2008 campaign.\r\nGenerals were quoted approvingly stating that the greatest threat to U.S. national security was the budget deficit. Bank bailouts, debt-ceilings and fiscal cliffs consumed not only the attention and energy of the White House -- for electoral as much as national reasons -- but defined sharply down the priority of new foreign policy initiatives (beyond, that is, the vastly expanded secret campaign of targeted assassinations of suspected Al Qaeda terrorists).\r\nWhat this legacy bequeaths to Kerry are two false choices that he must confront without alienating that same White House from which he will ultimately derive his influence. First, it is time to recognize that foreign policy begins just as often, and just as importantly, abroad. To be sure, from the earliest days of the Republic through World War II it has been understood that America''s global influence is built on its ability to back words with resources, and diplomacy with arms, investments and trade agreements.\r\nEven so, Chinese nationalism, terrorism in the Sahel, a savage civil war in Syria, climate change, cyberwarfare, the Iranian nuclear program and the E.U. crisis are challenges with distinct roots and reasons far beyond the shores of America. They need to be encountered and understood out there -- through patient, strategic and often uncomfortable negotiations that recognize the value of listening as much as talking.\r\nOtherwise, the risk of surprise on the scale of the one that struck on that cloudless day in New York a decade ago will remain -- and indeed increase -- in a fragmenting, rapidly changing world.\r\nSecond, Kerry must mount a new challenge to Washington''s ossified debate about intervention as an instrument of foreign policy. Syria will soon present him with the best (or worst, as the case may turn out) reason to do so. For the president''s critics, the U.S. should have taken a much more active, military, role far sooner -- including arming the opposition, imposing a no-flight zone and conducting targeted strikes against the regime.\r\nPresident Obama in an interview with The New Republic this week elaborated on why all of these options seem to him deeply unpalatable -- dwelling on everything from the risk of triggering the use of chemical weapons, to the impact on operations in Afghanistan, to the relative merits of acting in Syria vs. acting in the Congo in order to save lives.\r\nOf course, the fact that there isn''t a simple military solution to the Syria crisis is precisely what makes a dramatic and sustained diplomatic initiative so urgent -- and its absence so troubling (and the same argument can be made in relation to the Iranian nuclear challenge). One need have no illusions about the Russian or Chinese views of the crisis to appreciate that without a genuine negotiation where they will have to get in order to give, the slaughter will continue -- and risks of regional escalation spike.\r\nBut such has been the near-complete militarization of U.S. foreign policy over the past decade that for all intents and purposes the only alternative presented to an invasion of the country is a combination of drone strikes and targeted killings. The tried and tested principle of diplomacy backed by the threat of force has seen a near-total inversion. Axiomatic now as the only alternative to doing nothing is the use of lethal force backed by the occasional choice of diplomacy as clean-up job.\r\nThis is unworthy of a great power -- and a great foreign service. During his confirmation hearings, Kerry stated that ''''American foreign policy is not defined by drones and deployments alone.'''' If that remark is to be remembered as more than one man''s expression of hope over experience, he will have to make it so.\r\nTo engage, to cajole, to give and take, to offer incentives to allies and enemies alike in pursuit of interests global and national, political and economic, to wield diplomatic power and influence as only America can: That is Kerry''s opportunity now -- and his challenge.\r\nNader Mousavizadeh is chief executive of Oxford Analytica and the co-author, with Kofi Annan, of ''''Interventions: A Life in War and Peace.''''\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/opinion/global/memo-to-washington-foreign-policy-begins-abroad.html\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: February 2, 2013\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nDOCUMENT-TYPE: Op-Ed\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper', 'robbie');

SANGER\r\n\r\nSECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; NEWS ANALYSIS; Pg. 10\r\n\r\nLENGTH: 1558 words\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON -- Not quite nine months into his presidency, Barack Obama woke to the news that he had won the Nobel Peace Prize -- not for anything yet accomplished, but for the promise that he would end the Iraq war, win the ''''war of necessity'''' in Afghanistan, move toward the elimination of nuclear weapons, tackle climate change and engage America''s adversaries.\r\nYet beyond Iraq, his first-term accomplishments from that list are sparse. In a fractured world, President Obama struggled to define a grand strategy for America''s role, apart from preserving its pre-eminence while relying increasingly on a changing cast of partners.\r\nAs Mr. Obama begins his second term, aides and confidants say he is acutely aware that his ambitious agenda to restore America''s influence and image in the world stalled almost as soon as the prize was awarded. But the president has indicated that he plans to return to his original agenda, though he has hinted it may be in a different, less overtly ambitious way.\r\nBitter experience -- from getting the most modest arms control agreement through the Senate his first year, trying and failing to engage leaders in Iran and North Korea, discovering his lack of leverage over Egypt, Pakistan and Israel, and finding Afghanistan to be a costly waste of American lives and resources -- is driving him to a strategy reminiscent of one of his Republican predecessors, President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\r\nIt is a strategy in which Mr. Obama will try to redirect world events subtly, rather than turning to big treaties, big military interventions and big aid packages.\r\n''''The appeal of the Eisenhower approach is that it had a big element of turning inward, of looking to rebuilding strength at home, of conserving American power,'''' said one of Mr. Obama''s senior national security advisers, who would not agree to be quoted by name. ''''But there''s also the reality that some of the initiatives that seemed so hopeful four years ago -- whether it''s driving down the number of nuclear weapons or helping Afghanistan remake itself -- look so much harder now.''''\r\nWhether this approach can work is very much an open question. His early forays into covert action and lightning-quick strikes -- like the fast war in Libya or the cyberwar against Iran -- have set back adversaries, but the satisfactions of striking with a ''''light footprint'''' have usually been temporary at best.\r\nHis promises of transformative change are now viewed around the world with more suspicion. There was the student in Cairo who cornered a reporter a year ago and demanded to know why the prison at Guantánamo Bay was still open, and the European foreign minister who, at a diplomatic dinner in Washington, asked whether ''''the pivot to Asia is another phrase for ignoring the rest of the world.''''\r\nMr. Obama''s questions during Situation Room sessions, some of his current and former aides say, seem to reflect a concern that his first term was spent putting out fires, rather than building lasting institutions.\r\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt and President Harry S. Truman solidified America''s post-World War II role by helping create the United Nations, the international financial institutions and the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe; President John F. Kennedy emerged from the Cuban Missile Crisis with treaties limiting the spread of nuclear weapons; the first President George Bush lured new allies from the ruins of the Soviet Union.\r\nBy comparison, Mr. Obama''s biggest accomplishments have been largely defensive: a full withdrawal from Iraq and devastating strikes against the core leadership of Al Qaeda. (When President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan visited the White House last week, he was presented a scorecard: of the ''''20 most wanted'''' Qaeda leaders when Mr. Obama was first inaugurated, 13 were dead, along with many of their successors.)\r\nThe president''s national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, has argued in speeches since Mr. Obama''s re-election that in the first term the president built a broader alliance against Iran than any of his predecessors; that is true, but so far it has not moved the Iranians to limit their nuclear drive.\r\nThe United States has variously offered to increase aid to Egypt or restrict it if the country heads off on an illiberal path. So far neither approach has given Mr. Obama leverage in influencing the new government led by the Muslim Brotherhood. A promising start in building an economic and political partnership with China has devolved into an argument over whether the United States is seeking to contain China''s ambitions.\r\n''''He wants to be something more than a pure manager for the next four years,'''' said Jeffrey A. Bader, a longtime diplomat who was one of the White House architects of the ''''rebalancing'''' toward Asia. He added that Mr. Obama ''''understands that being a transformative president on a global stage is about more than good intentions and good plans. It''s about finding places where you are not dependent on adversaries who refuse to budge, or who benefit from demonstrating their hostility to the U.S.''''\r\nIf there is a big strategic bet in Mr. Obama''s second term, it may be that Asia is that place. The huge, unexpected burst in oil and gas production in the United States has bolstered Mr. Obama''s conviction that the United States has an opportunity to extract itself from an overdependence on events in the Middle East. In Asia, he has found a region more welcoming to American influence, largely because a greater American presence -- meaning more naval ships and more investment -- can quietly counterbalance China''s rising power.\r\nMr. Obama''s focus on Asia has reinforced his interest in the Eisenhower era. After the Korean War, Americans simply wanted to bring the troops home and focus on growth. Eisenhower had publicly committed to both balancing the budget and containing growing threats around the world, while in secret he began a broad rethinking of American national security called Project Solarium.\r\nJust as Mr. Obama has privately worried about being manipulated by generals who were trying to lengthen the American involvement in Afghanistan, Eisenhower left office warning of the ''''military-industrial complex'''' that he feared would dominate American decision making.\r\nAt the same time, those who work with Mr. Obama, and parse his questions in Situation Room debates over the ability of the United States to influence events in places like Syria or Mali or North Korea, say they sense in him a greater awareness than he had four years ago of the limits of American influence.\r\nHe asks more detailed questions about how sending 100 troops, or 10,000, might influence long-term outcomes. Paraphrasing the president, one aide said he is more likely to ask, ''''So if we put troops into Syria to stabilize the chemical weapons, what can they accomplish in a year that they couldn''t accomplish in a week?''''\r\nThat is a product of Mr. Obama''s bitter experience in 2009, when he yielded to advice from the military to send a surge of tens of thousands of troops into Afghanistan. He regretted it almost instantly. The move to an ''''Afghan good enough'''' strategy followed, with minimal goals and a quicker withdrawal of troops. Ever since, he has been hesitant to use traditional power in traditional ways.\r\n''''He has got to find the happy medium between not committing us to a decade-long ground war and choosing not to do anything,'''' said Anne-Marie Slaughter, who was the head of the State Department''s policy planning operation for Mr. Obama''s first two years in office and has urged him to intervene more strongly in humanitarian disasters.\r\nMr. Obama''s caution has incurred a cost. To much of the world, his presidency thus far looks unlike what they expected. He promised ''''direct engagement'''' with longtime adversaries, including Cuba, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea and Venezuela. He is one for five: only the generals running Myanmar responded to his letters, economic incentives and offers of a new relationship.\r\nIn what Mr. Obama once called the ''''war of necessity,'''' in Afghanistan, the complaint heard more often is that Mr. Obama has abandoned any pretense of accomplishment in favor of accelerating the withdrawal.\r\n''''The situation is obviously not very confidence-inspiring,'''' Hina Rabbani Khar, Pakistan''s foreign minister, said in an interview last week. ''''A responsible transition means that you have achieved your objectives and then you leave. It''s not ''We leave in January.'' It''s ''We leave when the objectives are achieved.'' ''''\r\nAnd what of the grand initiatives?\r\nA proposal for a very large reduction in deployed nuclear weapons has been in the hands of the White House for months, but the president has not acted on it. Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. promised a new push to win passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which was defeated during the Clinton administration. They have never submitted it to the Senate.\r\n''''We were assured by President Obama when he was elected that the U.S. would ratify this C.T.B.T.,'''' Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general of the United Nations, said on Friday. ''''But somehow, it has not happened.''''\r\nGiven the composition of the Senate, it is not likely to happen in a second term, either. So Mr. Obama, his aides say, will have to find another way; like Eisenhower, he will have to redirect American policy quietly, from the Oval Office.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/us/politics/obamas-foreign-policy-goals-appear-more-modest.html\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: January 21, 2013\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nDOCUMENT-TYPE: News Analysis\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper', 'robbie');

NEUMANN; Pg. 1\r\n\r\nLENGTH: 2205 words\r\n\r\nMENLO PARK, Calif. -- Many people cite Albert Einstein''s aphorism ''''Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.'''' Only a handful, however, have had the opportunity to discuss the concept with the physicist over breakfast.\r\nOne of those is Peter G. Neumann, now an 80-year-old computer scientist at SRI International, a pioneering engineering research laboratory here.\r\nAs an applied-mathematics student at Harvard, Dr. Neumann had a two-hour breakfast with Einstein on Nov. 8, 1952. What the young math student took away was a deeply held philosophy of design that has remained with him for six decades and has been his governing principle of computing and computer security.\r\nFor many of those years, Dr. Neumann (pronounced NOY-man) has remained a voice in the wilderness, tirelessly pointing out that the computer industry has a penchant for repeating the mistakes of the past. He has long been one of the nation''s leading specialists in computer security, and early on he predicted that the security flaws that have accompanied the pell-mell explosion of the computer and Internet industries would have disastrous consequences.\r\n''''His biggest contribution is to stress the ''systems'' nature of the security and reliability problems,'''' said Steven M. Bellovin, chief technology officer of the Federal Trade Commission. ''''That is, trouble occurs not because of one failure, but because of the way many different pieces interact.''''\r\nDr. Bellovin said that it was Dr. Neumann who originally gave him the insight that ''''complex systems break in complex ways'''' -- that the increasing complexity of modern hardware and software has made it virtually impossible to identify the flaws and vulnerabilities in computer systems and ensure that they are secure and trustworthy.\r\nThe consequence has come to pass in the form of an epidemic of computer malware and rising concerns about cyberwarfare as a threat to global security, voiced alarmingly this month by the defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, who warned of a possible ''''cyber-Pearl Harbor'''' attack on the United States.\r\nIt is remarkable, then, that years after most of his contemporaries have retired, Dr. Neumann is still at it and has seized the opportunity to start over and redesign computers and software from a ''''clean slate.''''\r\nHe is leading a team of researchers in an effort to completely rethink how to make computers and networks secure, in a five-year project financed by the Pentagon''s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, with Robert N. Watson, a computer security researcher at Cambridge University''s Computer Laboratory.\r\n''''I''ve been tilting at the same windmills for basically 40 years,'''' said Dr. Neumann recently during a lunchtime interview at a Chinese restaurant near his art-filled home in Palo Alto, Calif. ''''And I get the impression that most of the folks who are responsible don''t want to hear about complexity. They are interested in quick and dirty solutions.''''\r\nAn Early Voice for Security\r\nDr. Neumann, who left Bell Labs and moved to California as a single father with three young children in 1970, has occupied the same office at SRI for four decades. Until the building was recently modified to make it earthquake-resistant, the office had attained notoriety for the towering stacks of computer science literature that filled every cranny. Legend has it that colleagues who visited the office after the 1989 earthquake were stunned to discover that while other offices were in disarray from the 7.1-magnitude quake, nothing in Dr. Neumann''s office appeared to have been disturbed.\r\nA trim and agile man, with piercing eyes and a salt-and-pepper beard, Dr. Neumann has practiced tai chi for decades. But his passion, besides computer security, is music. He plays a variety of instruments, including bassoon, French horn, trombone and piano, and is active in a variety of musical groups. At computer security conferences it has become a tradition for Dr. Neumann to lead his colleagues in song, playing tunes from Gilbert and Sullivan and Tom Lehrer.\r\nUntil recently, security was a backwater in the world of computing. Today it is a multibillion-dollar industry, though one of dubious competence, and safeguarding the nation''s computerized critical infrastructure has taken on added urgency. President Obama cited it in the third debate of the presidential campaign, focusing on foreign policy, as something ''''we need to be thinking about'''' as part of the nation''s military strategy.\r\nDr. Neumann reasons that the only workable and complete solution to the computer security crisis is to study the past half century''s research, cherry-pick the best ideas and then build something new from the bottom up.\r\nRichard A. Clarke, the nation''s former counterterrorism czar and an author of ''''Cyber War: The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About It'''' (Ecco/HarperCollins, 2010), agrees that Dr. Neumann''s Clean Slate effort, as it is called, is essential.\r\n''''Fundamentally all of the stuff we''re doing to secure networks today is putting bandages on and putting our fingers in the dike, and the dike springs a leak somewhere else,'''' Mr. Clarke said.\r\n''''We have not fundamentally redesigned our networks for 45 years,'''' he said. ''''Sure, it would cost an enormous amount to rearchitect, but let''s start it and see if it works better and let the marketplace decide.''''\r\nDr. Neumann is one of the most qualified people to lead such an effort to rethink security. He has been there for the entire trajectory of modern computing -- even before its earliest days. He took his first computing job in the summer of 1953, when he was hired to work as a programmer employing an I.B.M. card-punched calculator.\r\nToday the SRI-Cambridge collaboration is one of several dozen research projects financed by Darpa''s Information Innovation Office as part of a ''''cyber resilience'''' effort started in 2010.\r\nRun by Dr. Howard Shrobe, an M.I.T. computer scientist who is now a Darpa program manager, the effort began with a premise: If the computer industry got a do-over, what should it do differently?\r\nThe program includes two separate but related efforts: Crash, for Clean-Slate Design of Resilient Adaptive Secure Hosts; and MRC, for Mission-Oriented Resilient Clouds. The idea is to reconsider computing entirely, from the silicon wafers on which circuits are etched to the application programs run by users, as well as services that are placing more private and personal data in remote data centers.\r\nClean Slate is financing research to explore how to design computer systems that are less vulnerable to computer intruders and recover more readily once security is breached.\r\nDr. Shrobe argues that because the industry is now in a fundamental transition from desktop to mobile systems, it is a good time to completely rethink computing. But among the biggest challenges is the monoculture of the computer ''''ecosystem'''' of desktop, servers and networks, he said.\r\n''''Nature abhors monocultures, and that''s exactly what we have in the computer world today,'''' said Dr. Shrobe. ''''Eighty percent are running the same operating system.''''\r\nLessons From Biology\r\nTo combat uniformity in software, designers are now pursuing a variety of approaches that make computer system resources moving targets. Already some computer operating systems scramble internal addresses much the way a magician might perform the trick of hiding a pea in a shell. The Clean Slate project is taking that idea further, essentially creating software that constantly shape-shifts to elude would-be attackers.\r\nThat the Internet enables almost any computer in the world to connect directly to any other makes it possible for an attacker who identifies a single vulnerability to almost instantly compromise a vast number of systems.\r\nBut borrowing from another science, Dr. Neumann notes that biological systems have multiple immune systems -- not only are there initial barriers, but a second system consisting of sentinels like T cells has the ability to detect and eliminate intruders and then remember them to provide protection in the future.\r\nIn contrast, today''s computer and network systems were largely designed with security as an afterthought, if at all.\r\nOne design approach that Dr. Neumann''s research team is pursuing is known as a tagged architecture. In effect, each piece of data in the experimental system must carry ''''credentials'''' -- an encryption code that ensures that it is one that the system trusts. If the data or program''s papers are not in order, the computer won''t process them.\r\nA related approach is called a capability architecture, which requires every software object in the system to carry special information that describes its access rights on the computer, which is checked by a special part of the processor.\r\nFor Dr. Neumann, one of the most frustrating parts of the process is seeing problems that were solved technically as long ago as four decades still plague the computer world.\r\nA classic example is ''''buffer overflow'''' vulnerability, a design flaw that permits an attacker to send a file with a long string of characters that will overrun an area of a computer''s memory, causing the program to fail and make it possible for the intruder to execute a malicious program.\r\nAlmost 25 years ago, Robert Tappan Morris, then a graduate student at Cornell University, used the technique to make his worm program spread throughout an Internet that was then composed of about only 50,000 computers.\r\nDr. Neumann had attended Harvard with Robert Morris, Robert Tappan Morris''s father, and then worked with him at Bell Laboratories in the 1960s and 1970s, where the elder Mr. Morris was one of the inventors of the Unix operating system. Dr. Neumann, a close family friend, was prepared to testify at the trial of the young programmer, who carried out his hacking stunt with no real malicious intent. He was convicted and fined, and is now a professor at M.I.T.\r\nAt the time that the Morris Worm had run amok on the Internet, the buffer overflow flaw had already been known about and controlled in the Multics operating system research project, which Dr. Neumann helped lead from 1965 to 1969.\r\nAn early Pentagon-financed design effort, Multics was the first systematic attempt to grapple with how to secure computer resources that are shared by many users. Yet many of the Multics innovations were ignored at the time because I.B.M. mainframes were quickly coming to dominate the industry.\r\nHope and Worry\r\nThe experience left Dr. Neumann -- who had coined the term ''''Unics'''' to describe a programming effort by Ken Thompson that would lead to the modern Unix operating system -- simultaneously pessimistic and optimistic about the industry''s future.\r\n''''I''m fundamentally an optimist with regard to what we can do with research,'''' he said. ''''I''m fundamentally a pessimist with respect to what corporations who are fundamentally beholden to their stockholders do, because they''re always working on short-term appearance.''''\r\nThat dichotomy can be seen in the Association for Computing Machinery Risks Forum newsgroup, a collection of e-mails reporting computer failures and foibles that Dr. Neumann has edited since 1985. With hundreds of thousands, and possibly millions, of followers, it is one of the most widely read mailing lists on the Internet -- an evolving compendium of computer failures, flaws and privacy issues that he has maintained and annotated with wry comments and the occasional pun. In 1995 the list became the basis for his book ''''Computer-Related Risks'''' (Addison-Wesley/ACM Press).\r\nWhile the Risks list is a reflection of Dr. Neumann''s personality, it also displays his longtime interest in electronic privacy. He is deeply involved in the technology issues surrounding electronic voting -- he likes to quote Stalin on the risks:, ''''It''s not who votes that counts, it''s who counts the votes'''' -- and has testified, served on panels and written widely on the subject.\r\nDr. Neumann grew up in New York City, in Greenwich Village, but his family moved to Rye, N.Y., where he attended high school. J. B. Neumann, Dr. Neumann''s father, was a noted art dealer, first in Germany and then in New York, where he opened the New Art Circle gallery after moving to the United States in 1923. Dr. Neumann recalls his father''s tale of eating in a restaurant in Munich, where he had a gallery, and finding that he was seated next to Hitler and some of his Nazi associates. He left the country for the United States soon afterward.\r\nHis mother, Elsa Schmid Neumann, was an artist. His two-hour breakfast with Einstein took place because she had been commissioned to create a colorful mosaic of Einstein and had become friendly with him. The mosaic is now displayed in a reference reading room in the main library at Boston University.\r\nDr. Neumann''s college conversation was the start of a lifelong romance with both the beauty and the perils of complexity, something that Einstein hinted at during their breakfast.\r\n''''What do you think of Johannes Brahms?'''' Dr. Neumann asked the physicist.\r\n''''I have never understood Brahms,'''' Einstein replied. ''''I believe Brahms was burning the midnight oil trying to be complicated.''''\r\nProfiles in Science: This is the 12th article in a series about leaders in science.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/science/rethinking-the-computer-at-80.html\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: November 1, 2012\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC: PHOTOS: PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY JIM WILSON/THE NEW YORK TIMES) (D1)\r\nCONCEPT: Peter G.

SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD\r\n\r\nSECTION: Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 6\r\n\r\nLENGTH: 997 words\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON -- Intelligence officials from several countries say Iran in recent weeks has virtually completed an underground nuclear enrichment plant, racing ahead despite international pressure and heavy economic sanctions in what experts say may be an effort to give it leverage in any negotiations with the United States and its allies.\r\nThe installation of the last of nearly 3,000 centrifuges at a site called Fordo, deep under a mountain inside a military base near the holy city of Qum, puts Iran closer to being able to build a nuclear weapon, or come up to the edge, if its leaders ultimately decide to proceed.\r\nThe United States, Israel and the United Nations have all vowed to prevent that from happening, imposing increasingly tough sanctions on the country and using cyberwarfare to slow its progress in obtaining a weapon. President Obama said last week that the time for a negotiated settlement was ''''running out.''''\r\nTalks this year between Iran and the so-called P5-plus-1 -- the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany -- have made little progress. The New York Times reported Sunday that the United States and Iran had reached an agreement in principle to hold direct talks after the American presidential election. Mr. Obama denied the report but said in Monday''s debate with Mitt Romney that he was open to such talks.\r\nIran''s progress at Fordo was disclosed by officials familiar with the findings of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency who have been to the site recently as part of their regular visits. The officials included some from European governments who have opposed taking military action to slow the Iranian program, arguing that sanctions -- with a mix of covert action -- are far preferable.\r\nThe report comes at a moment when Iran has emerged as a point of contention in the foreign policy debates surrounding the approaching election. Mr. Romney has charged that the president has been ''''weak'''' on Iran, and said that Iran''s production of nuclear material had expanded greatly during Mr. Obama''s tenure. But he also embraced diplomacy in the debate on Monday.\r\nAsked about the intelligence reports, Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said, ''''While we can''t comment on a report that has yet to be released, we remain concerned about Iran''s defiance of its international obligations.'''' He noted that ''''the president is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and continues to believe there is time and space for diplomacy.''''\r\nUntil just two months ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel suggested he would not allow the Fordo plant to go into operation, warning that once it did Iran would have begun to enter a ''''zone of immunity'''' where it could produce nuclear fuel without fear of an Israeli strike. Israel does not possess the bunker-busting bombs that would be needed to destroy the facility, though the United States does have one weapon that can do the job: the ''''massive ordnance penetrator'''' that just entered the American arsenal.\r\nIn September, however, Israeli officials suddenly stopped using the ''''zone of immunity'''' phrase, and Mr. Netanyanu told the United Nations that he could wait until late spring before any taking military action, saying that was when Iran would be on the cusp of the ability to produce a bomb. European and American officials interpreted that announcement as evidence that Mr. Netanyahu concluded that Israel could not get through the more than 200 feet of rock over the Fordo plant without American help.\r\nThe prospect of a renewed round of diplomacy may explain the pace of activity at the underground site. The fact that the Fordo plant is approaching full operation, shortening the amount of time it would need to build a weapon, gives Iran added ability to exert pressure on the United States and its allies. ''''When slapped with new sanctions,'''' said Mark Fitzpatrick, a former State Department official who now studies the Iranian program at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, ''''Iran typically likes to pick up the pace of its enrichment work to try to show that it can''t be pressured into submission.''''\r\nThe installation of the last centrifuges at Fordo represents a milestone for the Iranians that the Obama administration hoped to avoid. In September 2009, Mr. Obama, along with the leaders of Britain and France, revealed the existence of the site, in an effort to galvanize international efforts to stop Iran''s program. His top national security aides predicted that the public exposure would force Iran to abandon the plant.\r\nWhile that did not happen, a senior administration official said Thursday that the exposure of the plant''s existence three years ago ''''eliminated its use as a ''sneak out'' venue,'''' because it forced Iran to allow inspectors inside the facility. ''''Sneak out'''' is a phrase that connotes covert production of bomb fuel, while ''''break out'''' is used to describe a race for a bomb. Mr. Obama, in the Monday debate, insisted that ''''we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity,'''' a phrase that left many thinking that was the line he would not let Iran cross.\r\nWhile the plant is not yet fully running -- fewer than half of all its centrifuges are spinning out enriched uranium -- Iran could have it doing so within months, officials say. Fordo is designed to make ''''medium enriched'''' fuel that is relatively close to bomb grade, and American officials worry that, in a relatively short amount of time, that fuel could be converted to a type suitable for weapons. But as Mr. Vietor noted, with inspectors visiting, ''''We are in a position to closely observe Iran''s program and detect any effort by Iran to begin production of weapons-grade uranium.''''\r\nIn August, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Fordo was roughly three-quarters complete, and that Iran had installed 2,140 centrifuges there, a doubling since a previous report three months before.\r\n\r\nURL: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/world/middleeast/iran-said-to-complete-nuclear-enrichment-plant.html\r\n\r\nLOAD-DATE: October 26, 2012\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\r\n\r\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newspaper', 'robbie');
